awake ye muses nine sing me a stram dlvme
unwind the solemn twine and tie my valentine
dh the earth was made for lovers for damsel and hopeless swain
for sighing and gentle whispering and unity made of twain
all things do go a courting in earth or sea or air
god hath made nothing single but thee in his world so fair
the bride and then the bridegroom the two and then the one
adam and eve his consort the moon and then the sun
the life doth prove the precept who obey shall happy he
who wlll not serve the sovereign be hanged on fatal tree
the high do seek the lowly the great do seek the small
none cannot find who seeketh on this terrestnal ball
the bee doth court the rower the rower his suit receives
and they make merry wedding whose guests are hundred leaves
the wind doth woo the branches the branches they are won
and the father fond demandeth the maiden for his son
the storm doth walk the seashore humming a mournful tune
the wave with eye so pensive looketh to see the moon
their spirits meet together they make them solemn vows
no more he singeth mournful her sadness she doth lose
the worm doth woo the mortal death claims a living bride
night unto day is married morn unto eventide
earth is a merry damsel and heaven a knight so true
and earth is quite coquettish and beseemeth in vain to sue
now to the application to the readmg of the roll
to bringing thee to justice and marshalling thy soul
thou art a human solo a being cold and lone
wilt have no kind companion thou reapst what thou hast sown
hast never silent hours and minutes all too long
and a deal of sad rerection and wailing instead of song
theres sarah and eltza and emeltne so fair
and harriet and susan and she with curlmg hairl
thine eyes are sadly blinded but yet thou mayest see
six true and comely maidens sitting upon the tree
approach that tree with caution then up it boldly climb
and seize the one thou lovest nor care for space  tzme l
then bear her to the greenwood and build for hel a bower
and give her what she asketh jewel or bird or flower
and bring the fife and trumpet and beat upon the drum
and bid the world goodmorrow and go to glory home l

there is another sky
evel serene and fair
and there is another sunshme
though it be darkness thel e
never mind faded forests austin
never mind silent fields
here is a little forest
whose leaf is ever green
here is a brightel garden
where not a frost has been
in its unfading flowers
i hear the bright bee hum
prithee my brother
into my garden come
sic transit gloria mundi
thow doth the busy bee
dum vivlmus vivamus
i stay mine enemy
oh vem vidi view
oh caput capospie
and oh memento mon
when i am far from thee
hunah for peter parley
hurrah for damel boone
three cheels sir for the gentleman
who first observed the moon
peter put up the sunshme
patti arrange the stars
tell luna tea is waiting
and call your brother mars
put down the apple adam
and come away with me
so shalt thou have a pippin
from off my fathers tree
i climb the hill of science
i view the an dscape  er
such transcendental prospect
inc er beheld before
unto the legislature
my country bids me go
ill take my india rubbers
in case the wind should blow
during my education
it was announced to me
that gravitatlon stumbling
fell from an apple tree
the earth upon an axis
was once supposed to turn
by way of a gymnastic
in honor of the sun
it was the brave columbus
a sailing oer the tide
who notified the nations
of where i would reside
mortality is fatal
gentility is fine
rascality heroic
insolvency sublime
our fathers being weary
laid down on bunker hill
and tho full many a morning
yet they are sleeping still
the trumpet sir shall wake them
in dreams i see them rise
each with a solemn musket
a marching to the skies
a coward will iemain sir
until the fight is done
but an tm mortal hero
will take  hat and run
good bye sh i am going
my country calleth me
allow me sir at parting
to wipe my weeping ee
in token of our fnendship
accept this bonnie doon
and when the hand that plucked it
hath passed beyond the moon
the memory of my ashes
will consolation be
then farewell tuscarora
and farewell sir to thee
st valentine
on this wondrous sea
sailing silently
ho pilot hoi
knowest thou the shore
where no breakers roar
where the storm is oer
in the peaceful west
many the salls at rest
the anchors fast
thither i pilot thee
land ho eternity
ashore at last
i have a bird in spring
which for myself doth sing
the spnng decoys
and as the summer nears
and as the rose appears
robin is gone
yet do i not repine
knowing that bird of mine
though flown
learneth beyond the sea
melody new for me
and will return
fast in a safer hand
held in a truer land
are mine
and though they now depart
tell i my doubting heart
theyre thine
in a serener bright
in a more golden light
i see
each little doubt and fear
each little discord here
removed
then will i not rep me
knowmg that bird or minc
though flown
shall m a distant tice
bright melody for me
return
frequently the woods are plnk
frequently are brown
frequently the hills undres
behind my native town
oft a head is crested
i was wont to see
and as oft a cranny
where it used to be
and the earth  they tell me
on its axi turnedl
wonderful rotation
by but twelve performed
c z                                      l t
the feet of people walking home
with gayer sandals go
the crocus  till she rhes
the vassal of the snow
the lips at hallelujah
long years of practise bore
till bye and bye these bargemen
walked singing on the shore
pearls are the divers farthings
extorted from the sea
pinions  the seraphs wagon
pedestrian once  as we
night is the mormngs canvas
larceny  legacy
death but our rapt attention
to immortahty
my figures fall to tell me
how far the village lies
whoe peasants are the angels
whose cantons dot the skies
my classics veil their faces
my faith that dark adores
which from its solemn abbeys
such resurrection pours
there is a wold
which bcar a sword
can pierce an armed man
it hurls lts barbed syllables
and is mute again
but where it fell
the saved will tell
on patriotic day
some epauletted brother
gave his breath away
wherever runs the breathless sun
wherever roams the day
there is its noiseless onset
there is its victory
behold the keenest marksman
the most accomplished shot
times sublimest target
is a soul forgot
through lane it lay  through bramble
through dearing and through wood
bandittj often passed us
upon the lonely road
the wolf came peenng curious
the owl looked puzzled down
the serpents satin figure
ghd stealthily along
the tempests touched our garments
the lightnings pomards gleamed
fierce from the crag above us
the hungry vulture screamed
the satyrs fingers beckoned
the valley murmured iicome
these were the mates
this was the road
these children fluttered home
my wheel is in the dark
i cannot see a spoke
yet know its dripping feet
go round and round
my foot is on the tide
an unfrequented road
yet have all roads
a dearing at the end
some have resigned the loom
some in the busy tomb
find quaint employ
some with new  stately feet
pass royal through the gate
flinging the problem back
at you and i
i never told the burled gold
upon the hill that lies
i saw the sun  his plunder done
crouch low to guard his prize
he stood as near
as stood you here
a pace had heen between
did but a snake hlsect the brake
my life had forfeit been
that was a wondrous booty
i hope twas honet gained
those were the faij est mgots
that ever kissed the spade l
whether to keep the secret
whether to reveal
whether as i ponder
kidd will sudden sail
could a shrewd advise me
we might een divide
should a shrewd betray me
atropos decide
the morns are meeker than they were
the nuts are getting brown
the berrys cheek is plumper
the rose is out of town
the maple wears a gayer scarf
the field a scarlet gown
lest i should be old fashioned
ill put a trinket on
sleep is supposed to be
by souls of samty
the shuttmg of the eye
sleep is the station grand
down which on eithel hand
the hosts of witness stand
morn is supposed to be
by people of degree
the breaking of the day
morning has not occm red
that shall aurora be
east of eternity
one with the banner gay
one in the red array
that is the break of day
one sister have i in our house
and one a hedge away
theres only one recorded
but both belong to me
one came the road that i came
and wore my last years gown
the other as a bird her nest
builded our hearts among
she did not sing as we did
it was a different tune
herself to her a music
as bumble bee of june
today is far from childhood
but up and down the hills
i held her hand the tighter
which shortened all the miles
and still her hum
the years among
deceives the butterfly
still in her eye
the violets lie
mouldered this many may
i spilt the dew
but took the morn
i chose this single star
flom out the wide mghts numbers
sue  forevermore
the guest is gold and crimson
an opal guest and gray
of ermine is his doublet
his capuchin gay
he reaches town at nightfall
he stops at every door
who looks for him at morning
i pray him too  explore
the larks pure territory
or the lapwings shore
i would distil a cup
and bear to all my friends
drinkmg to her no more astir
by beck or burn or moor
baffied for just a day or two
embarrassed  nol afraid
encounter m my garden
an unexpected maid
she beckons and the woods stal t
she nods and all begin
surely such a country
i was never in
the gentian wcaves hct tinges
the maples loom is red
my departing blossoms
obviate patsde
a brief but patient illness
an hour to prepare
and one below this mornmg
is where the angels are
it was a soort procession
the bobolink was there
an aged bee addressed us
and then we knelt in prayer
we trust that she was willing
we ask that we may be
summer  sister  seraph
let us go with thee
in the name of the bee
and of the butterfly
and of the breeze  amen
a sepal petal and a thorn
upon a common summers morn
a flask of dew  a bee or two
a breeze  a caper m the trees
and im a rose
distrustful of the gentian
and jmt to turn away
the fluttering of her fringes
cjud my perfidy
weary for my
i will singmg go
i shall not feel the sleet  then
i shall not fear the snow
flees so the phantom meadow
before the breathless bee
so bubble brooks in deserts
on ears that dying he
burn so the evening spires
to eyes that closing go
hangs so distant heaven
to a hand below
we lose  because we wid
gamblers  recollecting which
toss their dice again
all these my banners be
i sow my pageantry
lnmay
it rises train by tram
then sleeps in state agam
my chancel all the plam
today
to lose  if one can find agam
to miss  if one shall meet
the burglar cannot rob  then
the broker cannot cheat
so build the hillocks gaily
thou little spade of nunc
leaving nooks for daisy
and for columbme
you and i the secret
of the crocus know
let us chant it softly
there is no more snow
to him who keeps an orchh heart
the swamps are pink with june
i had a guinea golden
i lost it in the sand
and tho the sum was simple
and pounds were in the land
still had it such a value
unto my frugal eye
that when i could not find it
i sat me down to sigh
i had a crimson robin
who sang full many a day
but when the woods were painted
he too did iyaway
time brought me other robms
their ballads were the same
still for my mlssmg troubadour
i kept the house at hame
i had a star in heaven
one pleiad was its name
and when i was not heedmg
it wandered from the same
and tho the skies are crowded
and all the mght ashme
i do not care about it
smce none of them are mme
my stol yhas a moral
i have a mlssmg friend
plciad its name and robm
and gumea m the sand
and when this mournful ditty
accompamed with tear
shall meet the eye of traitor
in country far from here
grant that repentance solemn
may seize upon his mind
and he no consolation
beneath the sun may find
there is a morn by men unseen
whose maids upon remoter green
keep their seraphic may
and all day long with dance and game
and gambol i may never name
employ their holiday
here to light measure move the feet
which walk no more the village street
nor by the wood are found
hele are the blrds that sought the sun
when last years distaff idle hung
and summers brows were bound
neer saw i such a wondrous scene
neer such a rmg on such a glcen
nor so serene array
as if the stars some summer olght
should swing thelr cups of chi ysolite
and revel till the day
like thee to dance like thee to sing
people upon the mystic green
i ask each new may morn
i wait thy far fantastic bells
announcing me in other dells
unto the different dawn
she slept beneath a lree
remembered but by me
i touchecl her crndlc mute
she recogolzed the foot
put on her carmme suit
and see
its all i have to bring today
this and my heart beside
this and my heart and all the fields
and all the meadows wide
be sure you count  should i forget
some one the sum could tell
this and my heart and all the bees
which in the clover dwell
morns like these  we parted
noons like these  she rose
fluttering first  then firmer
to her fair repose
n ever did she iisp it
it was not for me
she  was mute from transport
i  from agony
till the evening nearing
one the curtains drew
quick a sharper rustling
and this linnet flew
c z                                           z
so has a daisy vanished
from the fields today
so tiptoed many a slipper
to paradise away
oozed so in crimson bubbles
days departing tide
blooming  tripping  flowing
are ye then with god
if those i loved wele lost
the eriels voice would tell me
if those i loved were found
the bells of ghent would ring
did those i loved repose
the daisy would impel me
philip  when bewildered
bole hls riddle in
adrift a little boat adrift
and night is coming down
will no one guide a little boat
unto the nearest town
so sailors say  on yestelday
just as the dusk was blown
one bttle boat gave up its sture
and gmgled down and down
so angels say  on yesterday
just as the dawn was red
one little boat   erspent with gales
retrimmed its masts  redecked it sails
and shot  exultant on
summer for thee grant i may be
when summer days are hown
thy music still when whippoorwill
and oriole  are done
for thee to bloom ill skip the tomb
and row my blossoms oer
pray gather me
anemone
thy bower  forevermore
when roses cease to bloom sir
and violets are done
when bumblebees in solemn flight
have passed beyond the sun
the hand that paused to gather
upon this summers day
ihll idle lie  m auburn
then take my flowers  pray
if recollectmg were forgettmg
then i remember not
and if forgetting recollectmg
how near i had forgot
and if to miss were merry
and to mourn were gay
how very blithe the fingers
that gathered this today
garlands for queens may be
laurels  for rare degree
of soul or sword
ah  but remembering me
ah  but remembering thee
nature in chivalry
nature in charity
nature in equity
the rose ordained
nobody knows this little rose
it might a pilgrim be
did i not take it from the ways
and hft it up to thee
only a bee will miss it
only a butterfly
hastenmg from far journey
on its breast to he
only a bird will wonder
only a breeze will sigh
ah little rose  how easy
for such as thee to die
snow flakes
i counted till they danced so
their slippers leaped the town
and then i took a pencil
to note the rebels down
and then they grew so jolly
i did resign the prig
and ten of my once stately toes
are marshalled for a jig
before the ice is in the pools
before the skaters go
or any cheek at nightfall
is tarnished by the snow
before the fields have finished
before the christmas tree
wonder upon wonder
will arrive to me
what we touch the hems of
on a summers day
what is only walking
just a bridge away
that which sings so  speaks so
when theres no one here
will the frock i wept in
answer me to wear
by such and such an offering
to mr so and so
the web of bfe woven
so martyrs albums show
it did not surprise me
so i said  or thought
she will stir her pinions
and the nest forgot
traverse broader forests
build in gayer boughs
breathe in ear more modern
gods old fashioned vows
this was bu t a birdling
what and if it be
one within my bosom
had departed me
this was but a story
what and if indeed
there were just such coffin
in the heart instead
when i count the seeds
that are sown beneath
to bloom so bye and bye
when i con the people
lain so low
to be received as high
when i believe the garden
mortal shall not see
pick by faith its blossom
and avoid its bee
i can spare this summer unreluctantly
i robbed the wood
the tl ustmg woods
the unsuspectmg trees
brought out their burs and mosses
my fantasy to please
i scanned their trinkets cudous
grasped  i bore away
what will the olemn hemlock
what will the oak tree say

a day help help another day
your prayers oh passer by
from such a common ball as this
might date a victory
from marshallings as simple
the hags of nations swango
steady  my soul what issues
upon thine arrow hang
could live  dld live
could die  did die
could smile upon the whole
through faith m one he met not
to mtroduce his soul
could go from scene famihar
to an untraversed spot
could contemplate the journey
with unpuzzled heart
such trust had one among us
among us not today
we who saw the launchmg
never sailed the bay
if she had been the mistletoe
and i had been the rose
how gay upon your table
my vel vet life to close
since i am of the druid
and she is of the dew
ill deck traditions buttonhole
and send the rose to you
theres something quieter than sleep
within this inner room
it wears a sprig upon its breast
and will not tell its name
some touch it and some kiss it
some chafe its idle hand
it has a simple gravity
i do not understand
i would not weep if i were they
how rude in one to sob
might scare the quiet fairy
back to her native wood
while simplehearted neighbors
chat of the early dead
we  prone to penphrasis
remark that birds have red
i keep my pledge
i was not called
death did not notice me
i bnng my rose
i phght again
by every sainted bee
by daisy called from hillside
by bobolmk from lane
blossom and i
her oath and mine
will surely come again
heart we will forget him
you and i  tonight
you may forget the warmth he gave
i will forget the light
when you have done pray tell me
that i may straight begin
haste lest while youre laggmg
i remember him
once more my now bewildered dove
bestirs her puzzled wings
once more her mistress on the deep
her troubled question flmgs
thnce to the floating casement
the patnarchs bird returned
courage my brave columba
there may yet be land
i never lost as much but twice
and that was in the sod
twice have i stood a beggar
before the door of god
angels  twice descending
reimbursed my store
burglar banker  father
i am poor once more
i havent told my garden yet
lest that should conquer me
i havent quite the strength now
to break it to the bee
i will not name it in the street
for shops would stare at me
that one so shy  so ignorant
should have the face to die
the hillsides must not know it
where i have rambled so
nor tell the loving forests
the day that i shall go
nor iisp it at the table
nor heedless by the way
hmt that within the riddle
one will walk today
i often passed the village
when gomg home from school
and wondered what they did there
and why it was so stlll
i did not know the year then
in which my call would come
earlier by the dial
than the rest have gone
its stiller than the sundown
its cooler than the dawn
the daisies dare to come here
and birds can hutter down
so when you are tired
or perplexed  or cold
trust the loving promise
underneath the mould
cry its i iitake dollie
and i will enfold
whether my bark went down at sea
whether she met with gales
whether to isles enchanted
she bent her docile sails
by what mystic mooring
she is held today
this is the errand of the eye
out upon the bay
taken from men  this mornmg
carried by men today
met by the gods with banners
who marshalled her away
one little maid  from playmates
one little mind from school
there must be guests in eden
all the rooms are full
far  as the east from even
dim  as the border star
courtiers quaint in kingdoms
our departed are
if i should die
and you should hve
and time should gurgle on
and morn should beam
and noon should burn
as it has usual done
if birds should build as early
and bees as bustling go
one might depart at option
from enterprise below
tis sweet to know that stocks will stand
when we with daisies lie
that commerce will continue
and trades as briskly fly
it makes the parting tranquil
and keeps the soul serene
that gentlemen so spllghtly
conduct the pleasmg scene
by chivalries as tmy
a blossom or a book
the seeds of snules are planted
which blossom in the dark
if i should cease to bring a rose
upon a festal day
twill be because beyond the rose
i have been called away
if i should cease to take the names
my buds commemorate
twill be because deaths finger
claps my murmuring lip
to venerate the simple days
which lead the seasons by
needs but to remember
that from you or i
they may take the tribe
termed mortality
delayed till she had ceased to know
delayed till in its vest of snow
her loving bosom lay
an hour behind the fleetmg breath
later by just an hour than death
oh lagging yesterday
could she have guessed that it would be
could but a crier of the joy
have climbed the distant hl
had not the bliss so slow a pace
who knows but this surrendered face
were undefeated snll
oh if there may departing be
any forgot by victory
in her imperial round
show them this meek appareled thing
that could not stop to be a kmg
doubtful if it be crowned

the angel begged permission
to breakfast  to return
not so said cunning jacob
hi will not let thee go

the which acceded to
light swung the silver fleeces
peniel hills beyond

to gird us for the sun
whatgaze l

on our developed eyes
noons blaze
some rainbow  coming from the fair
some vision of the world cashmere
i confidently see
or else a peacocks purple train
feather by feather  on the plain
fritters itself away
the dreamy butterflies bestir
lethargic pools resume the whir
of last years sundered tune
from some old fortress on the sun
baronial bees  march  one by one
in murmuring platoon

as rakes of snow stood yesterday

sweeter than a vamshed frolic
from a vamshed green
swifter than the hoofs of holscmen

modest let us walk among it
with our faces veiled
as they say polite archangels
do in meeting god
not for me  to prate about it
not for you  to say
to some fashionable lady
charming april day
rather  heavens peter parleyl
by which children slow
to sublimer recitation
are prepared to go
so from the mould
scarlet and gold
many a bulb will rise
hidden away cunningly
from sagacious eyes
so from cocoon
many a worm
leap so highland gay
peasants like me
peasants like thee
gaze perplexedly
success is counted sweetest
by those who neer succeed
to comprehend a nectar
requires sorest need
not one of all the purple host
who took the flag today
can tell the definition
so clear of victory
as he defeated  dying
on whose forbldden ear
the distant strains of triumph
burst agonized and clear
ambition cannot find him
affection doesnt know
how many leagues of nowhere
lie between them now
yesterday undistmgulshed
eminent today
for our mutual honor
immortality
low at my problem bending
another problem comes
larger than mme  serenel
involving statelier sums
i check my busy pencil
my figures file away
wherefore my baffled fingers
thy perplexity
arcturus is his other name
id rather call him star
its very mean of science
to go and interfere
i slew a worm the other day
a savant passing by
murmured iiresurgam  centipede
loh lord  how frail are we
i pull a flower from the woods
a monster with a glass
computes the stamens in a breath
and has her in a iiclass
whereas i took the butterfly
aforetime in my hat
he sits erect in cabinets
the clover bells forgot
what once was heaven
is zemth now
where i ploposed to go
when times brief masquerade was done
is mapped and charted too
what if the poles should fnsk about
and stand upon their heads
i hope im ready for the worst
whatever prank betides
perhaps the kingdom of heavens changed
i hope the children there
wont be new fashioned when i come
and laugh at me  and stare
i hope the father in the skies
will hft his little girl
old fashioned  naughty  everythmg
over the stile of pearl
a throe upon the features
a hurry in the breath
an ecstasy of parting
denominated death
an angmsh at the mention
which when to patience grown
ive known permission given
to rejoin its own
glowing is her bonnet
glowing is her cheek
glowing is her kirtle
yet she cannot speak
better as the daisy
from the summer hill
vanish unrecorded
save by tearful rill
save by loving sumbe
looking for her face
save by feet unnumbered
pausing at the place
who never lost are unprepared
a coronet to findl
who never thirsted
flagons and cooling tamarind
who never chmbed the weal y league
can such a foot explore
the purple territories
on pizarros shore
how many legions ovelcome
the emperor will say
how many colors taken
on revolution day
how many bullets bearest
hast thou the royal scar
angelsl write promoted
on this soldiers brow
a lady red  amid the hill
her annual secret keeps
a lady white within the field
in placid lily sleeps
the tidy breezes with their brooms
sweep vale  and hill and tree
pnthee my pretty housewives
who may expected be
the neighbors do not yet suspect
the woods exchange a smile
orchard and buttercup and bird
in such a little while
and yet how still the landscape stands
how nonchalant the hedge
as if the resurrection
were nothmg very strange
she died at play
gambolled away
her lease of spotted hours
then sank as gaily as a turk
upon a couch of flowers
her ghost strolled softly oer the hill
yesterday and today
her vestments as the silver fleece
her countenance as spray
exultation is the going
of an inland soul to sea
past the houses  past the headlands
into deep eternity
bred as we among the moun tains
can the sailor understand
the divme mtoxication
of the first league out from land
i never hear the word escape
without a quicker blood
a sudden expectation
a hying attitude
i never hear of pnsons broad
by soldters battered down
but i tug childish at my bars
only to fall again
a poor  torn heart  a tattered heart
that sat it down to rest
nor noticed that the ebbing day
flowed silver to the west
nor noticed night did soft descend
nor constellation bum
intent upon the vision
of latitudes unknown
the angels  happening that way
this dusty heart espied
tenderly took it up from toil
and carried it to god
there  sandals for the barefoot
there  gathered from the gales
do the blue havens by the hand
lead the wandering sails
c zs
going to heaven
i dont know when
pray do not ask me how
indeed im too astonished
to think of answering you
going to heaven
how dlm it sounds
and yet it wlll be done
as sure as flocks go home at mght
unto the shepherds arm
perhaps youre gomg too
who knows
if you should get there first
save just a little space for me
close to the two i lost
the smallest robe will fit me
and just a bit of crown
for you know we do not mind our dress
when we are going home
im glad i dont believe it
for it would stop my breath
and id like to look a little more
at such a curious earthl
im glad they did believe it
whom i have never found
since the mighty autumn afternoon
i left them in the ground
our lives are swiss
so still so cool
till some odd afternoon
the alps neglect their curtains
and we look farther on
italy stands the other side
while like a guard between
the solemn alps
the shen alps
forever intervene
we should not mind so small a flower
except it quiet bring
our little garden that we lost
back to the lawn again
so spicy her carnations nod
so drunken reel her bees
so silver steal a hundred flute
from out a hundred tree
that whoso sees this little flower
by faith may clear behold
the bobolinks mound the throne
and dandelions gold
whose cheek is this
what rosy face
has lost a blush today
i found her  itpleiad  in the woods
and bore her safe away
robins in the tradition
did cover such with leaves
but which the cheek
and which the pall
my scrutiny deceives
heart not so heavy as mine
wendmg late home
as it passed my window
whistled itself a tune
a careless snatch  a ballad
a ditty of the street
yet to my irritated ear
an anodyne so sweet
it was as if a bobolink
sauntering this way
carolled and paused and carolled
then bubbled slow away
it was as if a chirping brook
upon a dusty way
set bleeding feet to mmuets
without the knowmg why
tomorrow night will come again
perhaps weary and sore
ah bugle by my window
i pray you pass once more
her breast is fit for pearls
but i was not a diver
her brow is fit for thrones
but i have not a crest
her heart is fit for home
i  a sparrow  build there
sweet of twigs and twine
my perennial nest
ivyhey have not chosen me he said
ubut i have chosen them
btave  broken heat ted statement
uttered  bethlehem
i could not have told it
but sce jew dared
sovereign know a daisy
thy dishonor shared
south winds jotle them
bumblebees come
hover  hesitate
drink and are gone
butterflies pause
on their passage cashmere
i  softly plucking
preent them here
c r                                          r
a darting fear  a pomp  a tear
a waking on a morn
to find that what one waked for
inhales the different dawn
as by the dead we love to sit
become so wondrous dear
as for the lost we grapple
tho all the rest are here
in broken mathematics
we estimate our prize
vast  in its fading ratio
to our penurious eyes
some thmgs that fly there be
buds  hour  the bumblebee
of these no elegy
some thmgs that stay there be
grief  hills  eternity
nor this behooveth me
there are that restmg rise
can i expound the skies
how still the riddle lies
withm my reach
i could have touched
i might have chanced that way
soft sauntered thro the village
sauntered as soft away
so unsuspected violets
within the meadows go
too late for strivmg fingers
that passed an hour ago
so bashful when i spied her
so pretty  so ashamed
so hidden in her leaflets
lest anybody find
so breathless till i passed her
so helpless when i turned
and bore her stluggling blushing
her simple haunts beyond l
for whom i robbed the dmgle
for whom betrayed the dell
many will doubtless ask me
but i shall never tell
my friend must be a bird
because it hies
mortal my friend must be
because it dles l
barbs has it hke a bee
ah cullous fliend
thou puzzlest me
went up a year this evening
i recollect it well
amid no bells nor brnvocs
the bystanders will tell
cheerful  as to the village
tranquli as to repose
chastened  as to the chapel
this humble tourist rose
did not talk of returning
alluded to no time
when were the gales propitious
we might look for him
was grateful for the roses
in lifes diverse bouquet
talked softly of new species
to pick another day
beguiling thus the wonder
the wondrous nearer drew
hands bustled at the moorings
the crowd respectful grew
ascended from our vision
to countenances new
a difference  a daisy
is all the rest i knew
angels in the early morning
may be seen the dews among
stoopmg  plucking  smiling  flying
do the buds to them belong
angels when the sun is hottest
may be seen the sands among
stooping  plucking  sighing  flying
parched the flowers they bear along
my nosegays are for captives
dim long expectant eyes
fmgers denied the plucking
patient till paradise
to such if they should whisper
of morning and the moor
they bear no other errand
and i no other prayer
sexton my masters sleeping here
pray lead me to his bed
i came to build the birds nest
and sow the early seed
that when the snow creeps slowly
from off his chamber door
daisies pomt the way there
and the troubadour
the lainbow never tells me
that gust and storm are by
yet is she more convmcing
than philosophy
my flowers turn from forulti
yet eloquent declare
what cato couldnt prove mc
except the bids were here l
one dignity delays for all
one mined afternoon
none can avoid thls purple
none evade this crown
coach it insures and footmen
chamber and state and throng
bells also in the village
as we ride grand along
what dignified attendants
what service when we pause
how loyally at parting
their hundred hats they raise
how pomp surpassing ermine
when simple you and i
present our meek escutcheon
and claim the rank to die
new feet withm my garden go
new fingers stir the sod
a troubadour upon the elm
betrays the solitude
new children play upon the green
new weary sleep below
and stili the pensive spring returns
and still the punctual snow
a science  so the savants say
c omparatlve aatomy
by which a single bone
is made a secret to unfold
of some rare tenant of the mold
else perished in the stone
so to the eye prospective led
this meekest flower of the mead
upon a winters day
stands representative in gold
of rose and lily mamfold
and countless butterfly
will there really be a morning
is there such a thing as day
could i see it from the mountains
if i were as tall as they
has itfeet like water lilies
has it feathers like a bird
is it brought from famous countries
of which i have never heard
oh some scholar oh some sailor
oh some wise man from the skies
please to tell a little pilgrim
where the place called morning lies
great caesar condescend
the daisy to receive
gathered by catos daughter
with your majestic leave
i have a king who doel nol speak
so  wondering  thrd the hour meek
i trudge the day away
half glad when it is night and sleep
if haply thro a dream to peep
in parlors shut by day
and if i do  when morning comes
it is as if a hundred drums
did round my pillow roll
and shouts fill all my childish sky
and bells keep saying victory
from steeples in my soul
and if i dont  the little bird
within the orchard is not heard
and i omit to pray
father thy will be doneu today
for my will goes the other way
and it were perjury
where i have lost i softer tread
i sow sweet hower from garden bed
i pause above that vanished head
and mourn
whom i have lost i pious guard
from accent harsh or ruthless word
feehng as if their pillow heard
though stone
when i have lost youll know by this
a bonnet black  a dusk surplice
a little tremor in my voice
like this
why i have lost the people know
who dressed in frocks of purest snow
went home a century ago
next bliss
to hang our head  ostensibly
and subsequent to find
that such was not the posture
of our immortal mind
affords the sly presumption
that in so dense a fuzz
you  too  take cobweb attitudes
upon a plane of gauze
the daisy follows soft the sun
and when his golden walk is done
sits shyly at his feet
he  wakmg  finds the flowel thele
wherefore  marauder  art thou here
because sir love is sweet
we are the flower  thou the sun
forgive w if as days decline
we nearer steal to thee
enamored of the parting west
the peace  the flight  the amethyt
nights possibility
twas such a little  little boat
that toddled down the bay
twas such a gallant  gallant ea
that beckoned it away
twas such a greedy greedy wave
that licked it from the coat
nor ever guessed the stately salh
my little craft was lost
surgeons must be very careful
when they take the knife f
underneath their fine incisions
stirs the culplit  life
by a flower  by a letter
by a mmble love
if i weld the rivet faster
final fast  above
n ever mind my breathless anvil
never mind repose
n ever mind the sooty faces
tugging at the forge
artists wrestled here
lo a tint cashmere l
lo a rose
student of the year
for the easel here
say repose
i i i
the bee is not afraid of me
i know the butterfly
the pretty people in the woods
receive me cordially
the brooks laugh loudel when i come
the breezes madder play
wherefore mine eye thy silver mists
wherefore oh summers day
where bells no more affright the morn
where scrabble never comes
where very nimble gentlemen
are forced to keep their rooms
where tired children placid sleep
thro centuries of noon
this place is bliss  this town is heaven
please pater pretty soon
oh could we climb where moses stood
and view the landscape oer
not fathers bells  nor factories
could scare us any more
our share of night to bear
om share of morning
our blank in bliss to fill
our blank in scormng
here a star and there a star
some lose their way
here a mist and there a mist
afterwards  day
good mght because we must
how intricate the dust
i would go to know
oh incognito
saucy saucy seraph
to elude me so
father they wont tell me
wont you tell them to
what inn is this
where for the night
peculiar traveller comes
who is the landlord
where the maids
behold what curious rooms
no ruddy fires on the hearth
no brimming tankards how
necromancer l landlord
who are these below
i had some thmgs that i called mine
and god that he called hls
tlll recently a rival claim
disturbed these amities
the property my garden
which havmg sown wlth care
he claims the pretty acre
and sends a balliff there
the station of the partles
forbids publicity
but justice is sublimer
than arms or pedlgree
ill instltute an action
ill vindicate the law
jove choose your counsel
i retain shaw
in rags mystenous as these
the shming courtiers go
veiling the purple and the plumes
veilmg the ermine so
smiling as they request an alms
at some imposing door
smiling when we walk barefoot
upon their golden hoor
my friend attacks my fnend
oh battle picturesque
then i turn soldier too
and he turns satirist
how martial is this place
had i a mighty gun
i thmk id shoot the human race
and then to glory run
talk with pludcncc to a beggar
of potosi and the mmes
reverently to the hungry
of your viands and your wines
cautious hint to any captive
you have passed enfranchised feet
anecdotes of air in dungeons
have sometimes proved deadly sweet
if this is fadmg
oh let me immediately fade
if this is dymg
bury me in such a shroud of red
if this is sleep
on such a mght
how proud to shut the eye
good evening gentle fellow men
peacock presumes to die
as watchers hang upon the east
as beggars revel at a feast
by savory fancy spread
as brooh in deserts babble sweet
on ear too far for the delight
heaven beguiles the tired
as that same watcher when the east
opens the lid of amethyst
and lets the morning go
that beggar when an honored guest
those thirsty lips to hagons pressed
heaven to us if true
a something in a summers day
as slow her flambeaux burn away
which solemmzes me
a something in a summers noon
a depth  an azure  a perfume
transcending ecstasy
and still within a summers night
a something so transporting bright
i clap my hands to see
then veil my too inspectmg face
lest such a subtle  shimmering grace
flutter too far for me
the wizard fingers never rest
the purple brook within the breast
still chafes its narrow bed
still rears the east her amber flag
guides still the sun along the crag
his caravan of red
so looking on  the night  the morn
conclude the wonder gay
and i meet corning thro the dews
another summers day

many cross the rhme
in this cup of mine
sip old frankfort air
from my brown cigar
in lands i never saw  they say
immortal alps look down
whose bonnets touch the firmament
whose sandals touch the town
meek at whose everlasting feet
a myriad daisy play
which sir are you and which am i
upon an august day
for each ecstatic mstant
we must an anguish pay
in keen and quivering ratio
to the ecstasy
for each beloved hour
sharp pittances of years
bitter contested farthings
and coffers heaped with tears
to fight aloud is very brave
but gallanter i know
who charge within the bosom
the cavalry of woe
who win and nations do not see
who fall and none observe
whose dying eyes no country
regards with patriot love
we trust in plumed procession
for such the angels go
rang after rank with even feet
and uniforms of snow
houses  so the wise men tell me
mansions mansions must be warm l
mansions cannot let the tears in
mansions must exclude the storm l
m any m anslons by his father
i dont know him snugly builtl
could the children find the way there
some would even trudge tomght
bring me the sunset in a cup
reckon the mornings hagons up
and say how many dew
tell me how far the morning leaps
tell me what time the weaver sleeps
who spun the breadths of bluei
write me how many notes there be
in the new robins ecstasy
among astonished boughs
how many trips the tortoise makes
how many cups the bee partakes
the debauchee of dews
also who laid the rainbows piers
also who leads the docile spheres
by withes of supple bluel
whose fingers string the stalactite
who counts the wampum of the mght
to see that none is due
who built this little alban house
and shut the windows down so close
my spirit cannot see
wholl let me out some gala day
with implements to flyaway
passmg pomposity
cocoon above cocoon below
stealthy cocoon why hide you so
vvhat all the world suspect
an hour and gay on every tree
your secret perched in ecstasy
defies imprisonment
an hour in chrysalis to pass
then gay above receding grass
a butterfly to gol
a moment to interrogate
then wiser than a surrogate
the universe to know
these are the days when birds come back
a very few  a bird or two
to take a backward look
these are the days when skies resume
the old  old sophistries of june
a blue and gold mistake
dh fraud that cannot cheat the bee
almost thy plausibility
induces my belief
till ranks of seeds their witness bear
and softly thro the altered air
hurries a timid leaf
dh sacrament of summer days
dh last communion in the haze
permit a child to join
thy sacred emblems to partake
thy consecrated bread to take
and thine immortal wine
besides the autumn poets sing
a few prosaic days
a little this side of the snow
and that side of the haze
a few incisive mornings
a few ascetic eves
gone mr bryants golden rod
and mr thomsons itsheaves
still is the bustle in the brook
sealed are the spicy valves
mesmeric fingers softly touch
the eyes of many elves
perhaps a squirrel may remain
my sentiments to share
grant me oh lord a sunny mmd
thy wmdy will to bear
i bring an unaccustomed wme
to hps long parchmg
next to mme
and summon them to drink
cracklmg with fever they essay
i turn my brimmmg eyes away
and come next hour to look
the hands still hug the tardy gla
the hps i would have cooled alas
are so superfluous cold
i would as soon attempt to warm
the bosoms where the frost has lam
ages beneath the mould
some other thirsty there may be
to whom this would have pointed me
had it remained to speak
and so i always bear the cup
if haply mine may be the drop
some pilgrim thirst to slake
if haply any say to me
unto the little unto me
when i at last awake
as children bid the guest good night
and then reluctant tum
my flowers raise their pretty lips
then put their mghtgowns on
as children caper when they wake
merry that it is mom
my flowers from a hundred cribs
will peep and prance again
perhaps youd like to buy a flower
but i could never sell
if you would like to borrow
until the daffodil
unties her yellow bonnet
beneath the village door
until the bees from clover rows
their hock and sherry draw
why i will lend until just then
but not an hour more

water is taught by thirst
land  by the oceans passed
transport  by throe
peace  by its battles told
love by memonal mold
birds by the snow
have you got a brook in your little heart
where bashful flowers blow
and blushing birds go down to drink
and shadows tremble so
and nobody knows so soll it flows
that any brook is there
and yet your httle draught of hfe
is daily dlunken there
why look out for the httle brook m march
when the rivers overflow
and the snows come hurrymg from the hills
and the bndges often go
and later in august it may be
when the meadows parching he
beware lest this little brook of hfe
some burning noon go dry
flowers  well  if anybody
can the ecstasy define
half a transport  half a trouble
with which flowers humble men
anybody find the fountain
from which floods so contra flow
i will give him all the daisies
which upon the hillside blow
too much pathos in their faces
for a simple breast like mine
butterbies from st domingo
cruising round the purple hne
have a system of aesthetics
far superior to mine
pigmy seraphs  gone astray
velvet people from vevay
belles from soe lost summer day
bees exclusive coterie
pans could not lay the fold
belted down with emerald
venice could not show a cheek
of a tint so lustrous meek
never such an ambuscade
as of briar and leaf displayed
for my little damask maid
i had lather wear her grace
than an ealls distmguished face
i had rather dwell like her
than be duke of exeter
royalty enough for me
to subdue the bumblebee
soul wilt thou toss again
by just such a hazard
hundreds have lost indeed
but tens have won an all
angels breathless ballot
lingers to record thee
imps in eager caucus
raffie for my soul
an altered look about the hills
a tyrian light the village fills
a wider sunrise in the morn
a deeper twilight on the lawn
a print of a vermillion foot
a purple finger on the slope
a fuppant by upon the pane
a spider at his trade again
an added strut in chanticleer
a bower expected everywhere
an axe shrill singing in the woods
fern odors on un travelled roads
all this and more i cannot tell
a furtive look you know as weil
and nicodemus mystery
receives its annual reply
some too fragile for winter winds
the thoughtful grave encloses
tenderly tucking them in from frost
before their feet are cold
never the treasures in her nest
the cautious grave exposes
building where schoolboy dare not look
and sportsman is not bold
the covert have all the children
early aged and often cold
sparrows unnoticed by the father
lambs for whom time had not a fold
whose are the little beds i asked
which in the valleys lie
some shook their heads and others smiled
and no one made reply
perhaps they did not hear i said
i will inquire again
whose are the beds  the tiny beds
so thick upon the plain
tis daisy in the shortest
a little further on
nearest the door  to wake the ist
little leontodon
tis iris sir and aster
anemone and bell
bartsia in the blanket red
and chubby daffodil
meanwhile at many cradles
her busy foot she plied
hummmg the quaintest lullaby
that ever rocked a child
hush epigea wakens
the crocus stirs her lids
rhodoras cheek is crimson
shes dreaming of the woods
then turning from them reverent
their bedtime tis she said
the bumble bees will wake them
when april woods are red
for every bird a nest
wherefore in timid quest
some little wren goes seeking round
wherefore when boughs are free
households m every tree
pilgrim be found
perhaps a home too high
ah aristocracy
the little wren desires
perhaps of twig so fine
of twine een superfine
her pride aspires
the lark is not ashamed
to build upon the ground
her modest house
yet who of all the throng
dancing around the sun
does so rejoice
she bore it till the simple veins
traced azure on her hand
till pleading round her quiet eyes
the purple crayons stand
till daffodils had come and gone
i cannot tell the sum
and then she ceased to bear it
and with the saints sat down
no more her patient figure
at twilight soft to meet
no more hel timid bonnet
upon the village street
but crowns instead and courtiers
and in the midst so fair
whose but her shy  immortal face
of whom were whispering here
this heart that broke so long
these feet that never flagged
this faith that watched for star in vain
give gently to the dead
hound cannot overtake the hare
that fluttered panting here
nor any schoolboy rob the nest
tenderness builded there
on such a night or such a night
would anybody care
if such a little figure
slipped quiet from its chair
so quiet  oh how quiet
that nobody might know
but that the little figure
rocked softer  to and fro
on such a dawn or such a dawn
would anybody sigh
that such a little figule
too sound asleep did lie
for chanticleer to wake it
or stirring house below
or giddy bird in orchard
or early task to do
there was a little figure plump
for every little knoll
busy needles and spools of thread
and trudging feet from school
playmates and holidays and nuts
and visions vast and small
strange that the feet so precious charged
should reach so small a goal
bless god he went as soldiers
his musket on his breast
grant god he charge the bravet
of all the martial blest
please god might i behold him
in epauletted white
i should not fear the foe then
i should not fear the fight
all overgrown by cunmng moss
all interspersed with weed
the little cage of currer bell
in quiet haworth laid
gathered from many wanderings
gethsemane can tell
thro what transportmg anguish
she reached the asphodel
soft fall the sounds of eden
upon her puzzled ear
oh what an afternoon for heaven
when bronte entered there
she went as quiet as the dew
from an accustomed bower
not like the dew did she return
at the accustomed hour
she dropt as softly as a star
from out my summers eve
less skillful than le verriere
its sorer to believe
she died  thts was the way she died
and when her breath was done
took up her simple wardrobe
and started for the sun
her little figure at the gate
the angels must have spied
since i could never find her
upon the mortal side
mute thy coronation
meek my vive ie roi
fold a tmy courtier
in thine ermine sir
there to rest revering
till the pageant by
i can murmur broken
master it was
the sun kept stooping  stooping low
the hills to meet him rose
on his side what transaction
on their side what repose
deeper and deeper grew the stain
upon the window pane
thicker and thicker stood the feet
until the tyrian
was crowded dense with armies
so gay so brigadier
that  felt martial stirrings
who once the cockade wore
charged from my chimney corner
but nobody was there
dust is the only secret
death the only one
you cannot find out all about
in his native town
nobody knew his father
never was a boy
hadnt any playmates
or early history
indubtnous laconic
punctual sedate
bold as a brigand
stiller than a fleet
builds like a bud too
christ robs the nest
robin after robm
smuggled to rest
except to heaven she is nought
except for angels  lone
except to some widewandering bee
a flower superfluous blown
except for winds  provincial
except by butterflies
unnoticed as a single dew
that on the acre lies
the smallest housewife in the grass
yet take her from the lawn
and somebody has lost the face
that made existence  home
the murmur of a bee
a witchcraft  yieldeth me
if any ask me why
twere easier to die
than tell
the red upon the hill
taketh away my will
if anybody sneer
take cale  for god is here
thats all
the breaking of the day
addeth to my degree
if any ask me how
artist  who drew me so
must tell
you love me  you are sure
i shall not fear mistake
i shall not cheated wake
some grinning morn
to find the sunnse left
and orchards  unbereft
and dollie  gone l
i need not start  youre sure
that night will never be
when frightened  home to thee i run
to find the windows dark
and no more dollie  mark
quite none
be sure youre sule  you know
ill bear it better now
if youll just tell me so
than when  a little dull balm grown
over this pain of mine
you stmg  again
musicians wrestle everywhere
all day  among the crowded air
i hear the silver strife
and  waking long before the morn
such transport breaks upon the town
i think it that new life
it is not bird  it has no nest
nor band  in brass and scarlet  drest
nor tamborin  nor man
it is not hymn from pulpit read
the morning stars the treble led
on times first afternoon
some  say  it is the spheres  at play
some say that bright majority
of vanished dames  and men
some  think it service in the place
where we  with late  celestial face
please god  shall ascertain
dying dying in the night
wont somebody bring the light
so i can see which way to go
into the everlasting snow
and jesus where is jesus gone
they said that jesus  always came
perhaps he doesnt know the house
this way jesus let him pass
somebody run to the great gate
and see if dolhes commg wait
i hear her feet upon the stair
death wont hurt  now dolhes here
a little bread  a crust  a crumb
a little trust  a demijohn
can keep the soul ahve
not portly mind but breathing  warm
conscious  as old napoleon
the night before the crown
a modest lot  a fame petite
a brief campaign of stmg and sweet
is plenty is enough
a sailors business is the shore
a soldiers  balls who asketh more
must seek the neighboring life
just lost when i was saved
just felt the world go by
just girt me for the onset with eternity
when breath blew back
and on the other side
i heard recede the disappointed tide
therefore as one returned i feel
odd secrets of the line to tell
some sailor skirting foreign shores
some pale reporter from the awful doors
before the seal l
next time to stay
next time the thmgs to see
by ear unheard
unscrutinized by eye
next time to tarry
while the ages steal
slow tramp the centuries
and the cycles wheel
c r                                           rr
a feather from the whippoorwill
that everlasting  sings
whose gallenes  are sunrie
whose opera  the springs
whose emerald nest the age spm
of mellow  murmunng thread
whose beryl egg what schoolboys hunt
in recess  overhead
c r                                           r
my river runs to thee
blue sea wilt welcome me
my river waits reply
oh sea look graciously
ill fetch thee brooks
from spotted nooks
say  sea  take me
c r                                           r
tho my destiny be fustian
hers be damask fine
tho she wear a silver apron
i a less divine
still my little gypsy being
i would far prefer
still my little sunburnt bosom
to her rosier
for when flosts thelr punctual fingers
on her forehead lay
you and i and dr holland
bloom eternallyl
roses of a steadfast summer
in a steadfast land
where no autumn lifts her pencil
and no reapers standi
mama never forgets her birds
though in another tree
she looks down just as often
and just as tenderly
as when her little mortal nest
with cunning care she wove
if either of her sparrows fall
she notices above
a wounded deer  leaps highest
rve heard the hunter tell
tis but the ecstasy of death
and then the brake is stilh
the smitten rock that gushes
the trampled steel that springs
a cheek is always redder
just where the hectic stings
mirth is the mall of anguish
in which it cautious arm
lest anybody spy the blood
and youre hurt exclaim
i met a king this aftemoon
he had not on a crown indeed
a httle palmleaf hat was all
and he was barefoot im afraid
but sure i am he ermine wore
beneath his faded jackets blue
and sure i am the crest he bol e
within that jacket pocket too
for twas too stately for an earl
a marquis would not go o grand i
twas possibly a czar petite
a pope or something of that kinci
if i must tell you of a holsc
my freckled monarch held the rein
doubtless an estimable beast
but not at all disposed to run
and such a wagon while i live
dare i presume to see
another such a vehicle
as then transported me
two other ragged princes
his royal state partook
doubtless the first excursion
these sovereigns ever took
i question if the royal coach
round which the footmen wait
has the sigmficance on high
of this barefoot estate
to leam the transport by the pam
as blmd men learn the sun
to die of thirst  suspectmg
that brooks in meadows run
to stay the homesick  homesick feet
upon a foreign shore
haunted by native lands the while
and blue  beloved air
this is the sovereign anguish
this  the signal woe
these are the patient laureates
whose voices  tramed  below
ascend m ceaseless carol
inaudible indeed
to us  the duller scholars
of the mysterious bard
if the foolish call them flowers
need the wiser tell
if the savants classify them
it is just as well
those who read the revelations
must not criticize
those who read the same edition
with beclouded eyes
could we stand with that old moses
ucanaan denied
scan like him the stately landscape
on the other side
doubtless we should deem superfluous
many sciences
not pursued by learned angels
in scholastic skies
low amid that glad belles lettres
grant that we may stand
stars amid profound galaxtes
at that grand right hand
in ebon box when years have flown
to reverently peer
wiping away the velvet dust
summers have sprmkled there
to hold a letter to the light
grown tawny now with tnne
to con the faded syllables
that quickened us like wine
perhaps a flowers shrivelled cheek
among its stores to find
plucked far away some morning
by gallant  mouldering hand
a curl perhaps from foreheads
our constancy forgot
perhaps an antique trinket
in vanished fashions set
and then to lay them quiet back
and go about its care
as if the little ebon box
were none of aur affair
rso
portraits are to dally faces
as an evening west
to a fine pedantic sunshine
in a satin vest
wait till the majesty of death
invests so mean a brow
almost a powdered footman
might dare to touch it now
wait till in everlasting robes
that democrat is dressed
then prate about preferment
and station and the rest
around this quiet coui tier
obsequlous angels wait
full royal is his retinue
full purple is his state
a lord might dare to lift the hat
to such a modest clay
since that my lord the lord of lords
receives unblushmgly
tis so much joy tis so much joy
if i should fail what poverty
and yet as poor as i
have ventured all upon a throw
have gained yes hesitated so
this side the victory
life is but life and death but death
bliss is but bliss and breath but breath
and if indeed i fail
at least to know the worst is sweet i
defeat means nothmg but defeat
no drearier can befall
and if i gain i oh gun at sea
oh bells that in the steeples be
at first repeat it slow
for heaven is a different thing
conjectured and waked sudden in
and might extinguish me
a fuzzy fellow without feet
yet doth exceedmg run
of vel vet is his coun tenance
and his complexion dun
sometime he dwelleth in the grass l
sometime upon a bough
from which he doth descend in plush
upon the passerby
all this in summer
but when wmds alarm the forest folk
he taketh damask residence
and struts in sewing silk
then finer than a lady
emerges in the spring
a feather on each shoulder
youd scarce recogmze him
by men yclept caterpillar
by me but who am i
to tell the pretty secret
of the butterfly
at last to be identified
at last the lamps upon thy side
the rest of life to see
past midnight past the molding star
past sunnse
ah what leagues there were
between our feet and day
i have never seen volcanoes
but when travellers tell
how those old  phlegmatic moun tams
usually so soll
bear withm  appallmg ordnance
fire and smoke and gun
taking villages for breakfast
and appalling men
if the stillness is volcamc
in the human face
when upon a pam titanic
features keep their place
if at length the smouldermg anguish
will not overcome
and the palpitating vineyard
in the dust be thrown l
if some loving antiquary
on resumpoon morn
will not cry with joy pompeii
to the hills return
im the little hearts easel
i dont care for pouting skies
if the butterfly delay
can i therefoie stay away
if the coward bumble bee
in his chimney cornel stay
i must resoluter be
wholl apologrze for me
dear old fashioned little hower
eden is old fashioned tool
birds are antiquated fellows
heaven does not change her blue
nor will i the little hearts ease
ever be mduced to do
ah necromancy sweet
ah wizard erudite
teach me the skill
that i instil the pain
surgeons assuage in vain
nor herb of all the plain
canheal l
i cautious scanned my little life
i winnowed what would fade
from what would last till heads like mine
should be adreaming laid
i put the latter in a barn
the former blew away
i went one wmtel mormng
and   my pnceless hay
was not upon the scaffold
was not upon the beam
and from a thnving farmer
a cyme i became
whether a thief did it
whether it was the wmd
whether deitys guiltless
my busmess is to find
so i begin to ransack
how is it hearts with thee
art thou wlthm the little bam
love provided thee
if i could bribe them by a rose
r d bring them every flower that grows
from amherst to cashmere
i would not stop for night or storm
or frost or death or anyone
my business were so dear
if they would linger for a bird
my tambourin were soonest heard
among the april woods
unwearied all the summer long
only to break in wilder song
when winter shook the boughs
what if they hear me
who shall say
that such an importunity
may not at last avail
that weary of this beggars face
they may not finally say yes
to drive her from the hall
as if some little arctic flower
upon the polar hem
went wandering down the latitudes
until it puzzled came
to continents of summer
to firmaments of sun
to strange bnght crowds of rowers
and birds of foreign tongue
i say as if this little rower
to eden wandered in
what then why nothing
only your inference therefrom
i lost a world  the other day
has anybody found
youll know it by the row of stars
around its forehead bound
a rich man  might not notice it
yet  to my frugal eye
of more esteem than ducats
oh find it  sir  for me
if i shouldnt be alive
when the robins come
give the one in red cravat
a memorial crumb
if i couldnt thank you
being fast asleep
you will know im trymg
with my gramte hpj
ive heard an organ talk sometimes
in a cathedral aisle
and understood no word it said
yet held my breath the while
and risen up  and gone away
a more bernardme glrl
yet  know not what was done to me
in that old chapel aisle

a transport one cannot contain
may yet a transport be
though god forbid it lift the lid
unto lts ecstasy
a diagram  of rapture
a sixpence at a show
with holy ghosts in cages
the universe would go
faith is a fine invention
when gentlemen can see
but microscopes are prudent
in an emergency
what shall i do  it whimpers so
this little hound within the heart
all day and night with bark and start
and yet it will not go
would you untte it were you me
would it stop whinmg  if to thee
i sent it  even now
it should not tease you
by your chair  or on the mat
or if it dare  to chmb your dizzy knee
or  sometimes at your side to run
when you were willmg
shall it come
tell carlo
h ell tell me
how many times these low feet staggered
only the soldered mouth can tell
try  can you stir the awful rivet
try  can you lift the hasps of steel
stroke the cool forehead  hot so often
lift  if you care  the listless hair
handle the adamantine fingers
never a thimble  more  shall wear
buzz the dull flies  on the chamber window
brave  shines the sun through the freckled pane
fearless  the cobweb swings from the ceiling
indolent housewife  in daisies lain
make me a picture of the sun
so i can hang it m my room
and make believe im getting warm
when others call it day
draw me a robm  on a stem
so i am heanng him ill dream
and when the orchards stop their tune
put my pretense  away
say if its really  warm at noon
whether its buttercups  that skim
or butterflies  that bloom
then  skip  the frost  upon the lea
and skip the russet  on the tree
lets play those  never come
its such a little thing to weep
so short a thing to sigh
and yet  by trades  the size of these
we men and women die
he was weak and i was strong  then
so he let me lead him in
i was weak and he was strong then
so i let him lead me  home
twasnt far  the door was near
twasnt dark  for he went  too
twasnt loud for he said nought
that was all i cared to know
day knocked  and we must part
neither  was strongest  now
he strove  and i strove  too
we didnt do it  thol
the skies cant keep their secret
they tell it to the hills
the hills just tell the orchards
and they  the daffodils
a bird  by chance  that goes that way
soft overhears the whole
if i should bribe the little bird
who knows but she would tell
i think i wont  however
its finer  not to know
if summer wele an axiom
what sorcery had snow
so keep your secret  father
i would not  if i could
know what the sapplme fellows do
in your newfashioned world
poor little heart
did they forget thee
then dinna care then dmna care
proud little heart
did they forsake thee
be debonnaire be debonnaire
frail little heart
i would not break thee
couldst credit me couldst credit me
gay little heart
like mormng glory
wind and sun  wilt thee array
i shall know why  when time is over
and i have ceased to wonder why
chnst will explain each separate anguish
in the fair schoolroom of the sky
he will tell me what peter promised
and i  for wonder at his woe
i shall forget the drop of anguish
that scalds me now  that scalds me now
on this long storm the rainbow rose
on this late morn  the sun
the clouds  like listless elephants
horizons  straggled down
the birds rose smiling in their nests
the gales  mdeed  were done
alas how heedless were the eyes
on whom the summer shone
the quiet nonchalance of death
no daybreak  can bestir
the slow  archangels syllables
must awaken her
for this  accepted breath
through it  compete with death
the fellow cannot touch this crown
by it  my tltle take
ah what a royal sake
to my necessity  stooped down
no wilderness  can be
where this attendeth me
no desert noon
no fear of frost to come
haunt the pelenmal bloom
but certain june l
get gabnel to tell  the royal syllable
get samts  with new  unsteady tongue
to say what trance below
most hke their glory show
fittest the crown
we dont cry tun and i
weare far too grand
but we bolt the door tight
to prevent a friend
then we hide our brave face
deep in our hand
not to cry  tim and i
we are far too grand
nor to dream  he and me
do we condescend
we just shut our brown eye
to see to the end
tim  see cottages
but oh so high
then  we shake  tim and i
and lest i  cry
tim  reads a little hymn
and we both pray
please sir i and tlm
always lost the way
we must dle  by and by
clergymen say
tlm  shall if i  do
itoolfhe
how shall we arrange it
tlm  was  so  shy
take us slmultaneous  lord

mornmg  is the place for dew
corn  ls made at noon
after dmner hght  for bowers
dukes  for setting sun
an awful tempest mashed the air
the clouds were gaunt and few
a black  as of a spectres cloak
hid heaven and earth from view
the creatures chuckled on the roofs
and whistled  the air
and shook their fists
and gnashed their teeth
and swung their frenzied hair
the morning lit  the birds arose
the monsters faded eyes
turned slowly to his native coast
and peace  was paradisel
im wife  ive finished that
that other state
im czar  im woman now
its safer so
how odd the girls life looks
behind this soft eclipse
i think that earth feels so
to folks in heaven  now
this being comfort  then
that other kind  was pain
but why compare
im wife stop there
i stole them from a bee
because  thee
sweet plea
he pardoned me
two swimmers wrestled on the spar
until the morning sun
when one  turned smiling to the land
oh god the other one
the stray ships  passing
spied a face
upon the waters borne
with eyes in death  still begging raised
and hands  beseeching  thrownl
my eye is fuller than my vase
her cargo  is of dew
and still my heart  my eye outweighs
east india  for you
he forgot  and i  remembered
twas an everyday affair
long ago as christ and peter
warmed them at the temple fire
thou wert with him  quoth the damsell
no  said peter twasnt me
jesus merely looked at peter
could i do aught else  to thee
a slash of blue
a sweep of gray
some scarlet patches on the way
compose an evening sky
a little purple  slipped between
some ruby trousers hurried on
a wave of gold
a bank of day
this just makes out the morning sky
i should not dare to leave my friend
because  because if he should die
while i was gone  and i  too late
should reach the heart that wanted me
if i should disappoint the eyes
that hunted  hunted so  to see
and could not bear to shut until
they noticed me  they noticed me
if i should stab the patient faith
so sule id come  so sure id come
it hstening  listenmg  went to sleep
tellmg my tardy name
my heart would wish it broke before
smce breakmg then  smce breakmg then
were useless as next mornings sun
where midmght frosts  had lam
the flower must not blame the bee
that seeketh his felicity
too often at her door
but teach the footman from vevay
mistress is not at ilame  to say
to people  any more
tho i get home how late  how late
so i get home  twill compensate
better will be the ecstasy
that they have done expecting me
when night  descendmg  dumb  and dark
they hear my unexpected knock
transporting must the moment be
brewed from decades of agony
to think just how the fire will burn
just how longcheated eyes will turn
to wonder what myself will say
and what itself will say to me
beguiles the centuries of wayl
the rose did caper on her cheek
her bodice rose and fell
her pretty speech  like drunken men
did stagger pitiful
her fingers fumbled at her work
her needle would not go
what ailed so smart a little maid
it puzzled me to know
till opposite  i spied a cheek
that bore another rose
just opposite  another speech
that like the drunkard goes
a vest that like her bodice danced
to the immortal tune
till those two troubled little clocks
ticked softly into one
with thee in the desert
with thee in the thirst
with thee in the tamarind wood
leopard breathes  at last l
the thought beneath so slight a film
is more distinctly seen
as laces just reveal the surge
or mists  the apennine
come slowly  eden
lips unused to thee
bashful sip thy jessammes
as the faintmg bee
reaching late his bower
round her chamber hums
counts his nectars
enters  and is lost in balms
least rivers  docile to some sea
my caspian  thee
did the harebell loose her girdle
to the lover bee
would the bee the harebell hallow
much as formerly
did the paradise  persuaded
yield her moat of pearl
would the eden he an eden
or the earl an earl
i taste a liquor never brewed
from tankards scooped in pearl
not all the vats upon the rhine
yield such an alcoholl
inebriate of air  am i
and debauchee of dew
reeling  thro endless summer days
from inns of molten blue
when landlords turn the drunken bee
out of the foxgloves door
when butterflies  renounce their drams
i shall but drink the morel
till seraphs swing their snowy hats
and saints  to wmdows run
to see the little tippler
leaning against the  sun
what is  paradise
who live there
are they farmers
do they hoe
do they know that this is amherst
and that i  am coming  too
oesm eden
do th ey wear new sh
is it always pleasant  there
wont they scold us  when were homesick
or tell god  how cross we are
you are sure theres such a person
as a father  in the sky
so if i get lost  there  ever
or do what the nurse calls die
i shant walk the jasper  barefoot
ransomed folks  wont laugh at me
maybe  eden ant so lonesome
as new england used to be
safe in their alabastel chambers
untouched by morning
and untouched by noon
sleep the meek members of the resurrection
rafter of satin
and roof of stone
light laughs the breeze
in her castle above them
babbles the bee in a stolid ear
pipe the sweet birds in ignorant cadence
ah what sagacity perished here
version of
safe in their alabaster chambers
untouched by morning
and untouched by noon
lie the meek members of the resurrection
rafter of satin  and roof of stone
grand go the years  in the crescent  above them
worlds scoop their arcs
and firmaments  row
diadems  drop  and doges  surrender
soundless as dots  on a disc of snow
version of
savior ive no one else to tell
and so i trouble thee
i am the one forgot thee so
dost thou remember me
nor for myself i came so far
that were the little load
i brought thee the imperial heart
i had not strength to hold
the heart i carned m my own
till mine too heavy grew
yet  strangest  heavier smce it went
is it too large for you
is it true dear sue
are there two
i shouldnt like to come
for fear of joggling him
if i could shut him up
in a coffee cup
or tie him to a pin
till igotm
or make him fast
to tobys fist
hist whist i d come
she sweeps with manycolored brooms
and leaves the shreds behmd
oh housewife in the evening west
come back and dust the pond
you dropped a purple ravelling in
you dropped an amber thread
and now youve littered all the east
with duds of emerald l
and still she plies her spotted brooms
and still the aprons hy
till brooms fade softly into stars
and then i come away
could i  then  shut the door
lest my beseeching face  at last
rejected  be  of her
it cant be summer
that  got through
its early  yet  for spring
theres that long town of white  to cross
before the blackbirds smg
it cant be dymg
its too rouge
the dead shall go m white
so sunset shuts my questlon down
with cuffs of chrysolite
when katie walks this simple pair accompany her side
when katie runs unwearied they follow on the road
when katie kneels their loving hands still clasp her pious knee
ah katie smile at fortune with two so knit to thee

i came to buy a smile  today
but just a single smile
the smallest one upon your face
will suit me just as well
the one that no one else would miss
it shone so very small
im pleading at the counter  sir
could you afford to sell
ive dtamonds  on my fingers
you know what diamonds are
ive rubles like the evening blood
and topaz  like the star
twould be a bargam for a jew l
say  may i have it  sir
ive nothing else  to bring you know
so i keep bringing these
just as the night keeps fetching stars
to our familiar eyes
maybe we shouldnt mind them
unless they didnt come
then  maybe it would puzzle us
to find our way home
jesus thy crucifix
enable thee to guess
the smaller sizel
jesus l thy second face
mind thee in paradise
of ours
should you but fail at  sea
in sight of me
or doomed lie
next sun  to die
or rap  at paradise  unheard
id harass god
until he let you in
teach him  when he makes the names
such an one  to say
on his babbling  berry  lips

blazing in gold and quenching in purple
leaping like leopards to the sky
then at the feet of the old horizon
laying her spotted face to die
stooping as low as the otters window

with shapeless  quivering  prayer
that you  so late  consider me
the sparrow of your care
i mind me that of anguish  sent
some drifts were moved away
before my simple bosom  broke
and why not this  if they

kill your balm  and its odors bless you
bare your jessamme  to the storm
and she will ring her maddest perfume
haply  your summer night to charm
stab the bird  that built in your bosom
oh could you catch her last refram
bubble forgive  some better  bubble
carol for him  when i am gone
heaven  is what i cannot reach
the apple on the tree
provided it do hopeless  hang
that  heaven is  to me
the color on the crulslng cloud
the interdicted land
behind the hill the house behind
there  paradise  is found
her teasing purples  afternoons
the credulous  decoy
enamored  of the conjuror
that spumed us  yesterday
ah moon  and star
you are very far
but were no one
farther than you
do you think r d stop
for a firmament
or a cubit  or so
i could borrow a bonnet
of the lark
and a chamois silver boot
and a stirrup of an antelope
and be with you  tomght
but moon and star
though youre very far
there is one  farther than you
he  is more than a firmament  from me
so i can never go
i like a look of agony
because i know its true
men do not sham convulsion
nor simulate a throe
the eyes glaze once  and that is death
impossible to feign
the beads upon the forehead
by homely anguish strung
when we stand on the tops of things
and like the trees look down
the smoke all cleared away from it
and mirrors on the scene
just laying light  no soul will wmk
except it have the haw
the sound ones like the hills  shall stand
no lightning scares away
the perfect nowhere be afraid
they bear their dauntless heads
iio
where others dare not go at noon
protected by their deeds
the stars dare shme occasionally
upon a spotted world
and suns go surer for their proof
as if an axle held
ive known a heaven like a tent
to wrap its shining yards
pluck up its stakes and disappear
without the sound of boards
or rip of nail  or carpenter
but just the miles of stare
that signalize a shows retreat
in north amenca
no trace  no figment of the thing
that dazzled yesterday
no ring  no marvel
men and feats
dissolved as utterly
as birds far navlgation
discloses just a hue
a plash of oars a gaiety
then swallowed up of view

it is easy to work when the soul is at play
but when the soul is in pain
the hearing him put his playthings up
makes work difficult  then
it is simple to ache in the bone or the rind
but gimlets  among the nerve

mangle daintier  terribler
like a panther m the glove
i held a jewel m my fingers
and went to sleep
the day was warm and wmds were prosy
i said  twill keep
i woke  and chid my honest fingers
the gem was gone
and now an amethyst remembrance
is all i own
forever at his side to walk
the smaller of the two
brain of his brain
blood of his blood
two lives  one being  now
forever of his fate to taste
if grief  the largest part
if joy  to put my piece away
for that beloved heart
all life  to know each other
whom we can never learn
and bye and bye  a change
called heaven
rapt neighborhoods of men
just finding out  what puzzled us
without the lexicon
what would i give to see his face
jd give  d give my hfe  of course
but that is not enough
stop just a mmute let me thmk l
d give my biggest bobolink
that makes two  hzm  and life l

d give her
roses a day from zanzibar
and lily tubes like wells
bees  by tle furlong
straits of blue
navies of butterflies  sailed thro
and dappled cowslip dells

daffodil downes  spicy stocks
dominions  broad as dew
bags of doubloons  adventurous bees
brought me  from firmamental seas
and purple  flom peru
now  have i bought it
shylock say
sign me the bondl
iii vow to pay
to her  who pledges thzs
one hour  of her sovereigns face
ecstatic contract
niggard grace
my kingdomsworth of bliss
why  do they shut me out of heaven
did i sing  too loud
but  i can say a littleminor
timid as a bird
wouldnt the angels try me
just  once  more
just  see  if i troubled them
but dont  shut the door
oh if i  were the gentleman
in the white robe
and they  were the little hand  that knocked
could  i  forbid
wlld nights  wild nlghts
were i with thee
wild nights should be
our luxury
futile  the winds
to a heart in port
done wlth the compass
done with the chart
rowing in eden
ah the sea
might i but moor  tonight
in thee
i shall keep singing
birds will pass me
on their way to yellower climes
each  with a robins expectation
i  wlth my redbreast
and my rhymes
late  when i take my place in summer
but  i shall bring a fuller tune
vespers  are sweeter than matins  signor
morning  only the seed of noon

i can wade grief
whole pools of it
im used to that
but the least push of joy
breaks up my feet
and i tip  drunken
let no pebble  smile
twas the new liquor
that was all
power is only pain
stranded thro disciplme
till weights  will hang
give balm  to giants
and theyll wilt like men

you see i cannot see  your lifetime
i must guess
how many times it ache for me  today  confess
how many times for my far sake
the brave eyes film
but i guess guessing hurts
mine  get so dim
too vague  the face
my own  so patient  covers
too far  the strength
my timidness enfolds
haunting the heart
like her translated faces
teasing the want
it  only  can suffice
hope is the thing with feathers
that perches in the soul
and sings the tune without the words
and never stops  at all
and sweetest  in the gale  is heard
and sore must be the storm
that could abash the little bird
that kept so many warm
ive heard it in the chillest land
and on the strangest sea
yet never in extremity
it asked a crumb  of me
to die  takes just a little while
they say it doesnt hurt
its only famter  by degrees
and then  its out of sight
a darker ribbon  for a day
a crape upon the hat
and then the pretty sunshme comes
and helps us to forget
the absent  mystic  creature
that but for love of us
had gone to sleep  that soundest time
without the weariness
if im lost  now
that i was found
shall still my transport be
that once  on me  those jasper gates
blazed open  suddenly
that in my awkward  gazing  face
the angels  softly peered
and touched me with their fleeces
almost as if they cared
im banished  now  you know it
how foreign that can be
youll know  sir  when the saviors face
turns so  away from you
delight is as the flight
or in the ratio of it
as the schools would say
the rainbows way
a skein
flung colored after rain
would suit as bright
except that hight
were aliment
if it would last
i asked the east
when that bent stnpe
struck up my childish
firmament
and i for glee
took rainbows as the common way
and empty skies
the eccentricity
and so with lives
and so with butterflies
seen magic  through the fnght
that they will cheat the sight
and dower latitudes far on
some sudden morn
our portion  in the fashion
done
theres a certain slant of light
winter afternoons
that oppresses like the heft
of cathedral tunes
heavenly hurt it gives us
we can find no scar
but internal difference
where the meanings are
none may teach it  any
tis the seal despair
an imperial affliction
sent us of the air
when it comes the landscape listens
shadows  hold their breath
when it goes tis like the distance
on the look of death

good night l which put the candle out
a jealous zephyr  not a doubt
ah friend you little knew
how long at that celestial wick
the angels  labored diligent
extinguished  now  for you
it might  have been the light house spark
some sailor  rowmg in the dark
had importuned to seel
it might  have been the waning lamp
that ht the drummer from the camp
to purer reveille

read  sweet  how others  strove
till we  are stouter
what they  renounced
till we  are less afraid
how many times they  bore the faithful witness
till we  are helped
as if a kingdom  cared i
read then  of faith
that shone above the fagot
clear strains of hymn
the river could not drown
brave names of men
and celestial women
passed out  of record
into  renown
put up my lute
what of  my music
smce the sole ear i cared to chalm
passive  as granite laps my music
sobbing  will suit  as well as psalm
would but the memnon of the desert
teach me the strain
that vanquished him
when he  surrendered to the sunrise
maybe  that  would awaken  them
the lonesome for they know not what
the eastern exiles  be
who strayed beyond the amber lme
some madder holiday
and ever since  the purple moat
they strive to climb  in vain
as birds  that tumble from the clouds
do fumble at the strain
the blessed ether  taught them
some transatlantic morn
when heaven  was too common  to miss
too sure  to dote upon
a single screw of flesh
is all that pins the soul
that stands for deity to mine
upon my side the veil
once witnessed of the gauze
its name is put away
as far from mine as if no phght
had printed yesterday
in tender  solemn alphabet
my eyes just turned to see
when it was smuggled by my sight
into eternity
more hands  to hold  these are but two
one more newmailed nerve
just granted for the perils sake
some striding  giant  love
so greater than the gods can show
they slink before the clay
that not for all their heaven can boast
will let its keepsake  go
a weight with needles on the pounds
to push and pierce besides
that if the flesh resist the heft
the puncture  coolly tries
that not a pore be overlooked
of all this compound frame
as manifold for anguish
as species  be  for name
where ships of purple  gently toss
on seas of daffodil
fantastic sailors  mingle
and then  the wharf is still

this  is the land  the sunset washes
these  are the banks of the yellow sea
where is rose  or whither it rushes
these  are the western mystery
night after night
her purple traffic
strews the landmg with opal bales
merchantmen  poise upon horizons
dip  and vamsh like orioles

bound  a trouble
and lives can bear it
limit  how deep a bleeding go
so  many  drops  of vital scarlet
deal with the soul
as with algebra
tell it the ages  to a cypher
and it will ache  contented  on
sing  at its pain  as any workman
notching the fall of the even sun
one life of so much consequence
yet i  for it  would pay
my souls entire income
in ceaseless  salary
one pearl to me  so signal
that i would instant dive
although  i knew  to take it
would cost me  just a ltfe
the sea is full i know it
that  does not blur my gem
it bums  distinct from all the row
intact  in diadem
the life is thick  i know it
yet  not so dense a crowd
but monarchs  are percepttble
far down the dustiest roadl
a solemn thing  it was  i said
a woman  white  to be
and wear  if god should count me fit
her blameless mystery
a hallowed thmg  to drop a life
into the purple well
too plummetless  that it return
eternity  until
i pondered how the bliss would look
and would it feel as big
when i could take it in my hand
as hovering  seen  through fog
and then  the size of this small life
the sages  call it small
swelled like horizons  in my vest
and i sneered  softly  small
i breathed enough to take the trick
and now removed from air
i simulate the breath so well
that one to be quite sure
the lungs are stirless  must descend
among the cunning cells
and touch the pantomime  himself
how numb the bellows feels
he put the belt around my life
i heard the buckle snap
and turned away imperial
my lifetime folding up
deliberate as a duke would do
a kingdoms title deed
henceforth a dedlcated sort
a member of the cloud
yet not too far to come at call
and do the little toils
that make the circult of the rest
and deal occasional smiles
to lives that stoop to notice mine
and kindly ask it in
whose invitation know you not
for whom i must decline
the only ghost i ever saw
was dressed in mechlin  so
he wore no sandal on hls foot
and stepped like rakes of snow
his gait  was soundless like the bird
but rapid like the roe
his fashions quaint mosaic
or haply mistletoe
his conversation  seldom
his laughter like the breeze
that dles away in dimples
among the pensive trees
our interview  was transient
of me himself was shy
and god forbid i look behind
since that appalling day
doubt me my dim companion
why god would be content
with but a fraction of the life
poured thee without a stint
the whole of me  forever
what more the woman can
say qulck that i may dower thee
with last delight i own
it cannot be my spirit
for that was thine before
i ceded all of dust i knew
what opulence the more
had i  a freckled maiden
whose farthest of degree
was  that she might
some distant heaven
dwell timidly with thee
sift her from brow to barefoot
strain tlll your last surmise
drop like a tapestry away
before the fires eyes
winnow her finest fondness
but hallow just the snow
intact in everlasting flake
oh caviler for you
many a phrase has the english language
i have heard but one
low as the laughter of the cricket
loud as the thunders tongue
murmuring like old caspian choirs
when the tides a lull
saying itself in new inflection
like a whippoorwill
breaking in bright orthography
on my simple sleep
thundering its prospecdve
till i stir and weep
not for the sorrow done me
but the push of joy
say it again saxon
hush  only to me
what if i say i shall not wait
what if i burst the beshly gate
and pass escaped  to thee l
what if i file this mortal off
see where it hurt me  thats enough
and wade in liberty
they cannot take me  any more
dungeons can call and guns implore
unmeamng  now  to me
as laughter  was  an hour ago
or laces  or a travelling show
or who died  yesterday
a shady friend  for torrid days
is easier to find
than one of higher temperature
for frigid  hour of mind
the vane a httle to the east
scares muslin souls  away
if broadcloth hearts are firmer
than those of organdy
who is to blame the weaver
ah the bewildering thread
the tapestlles of paradise
so notelessly  are made
tie the strings to my life my lord
then i am ready to go
just a look at the horses
rapid that will do
put me m on the firmest side
so i shall never fall
for we must ride to the judgment
and its partly down hill
but never i mind the steepest
and never i mmd the sea
held fast m everlastmg race
by my own choice and thee
goodbye to the life i used to bve
and the w orid i used to know
and kiss the hills for me just once
then  i am ready to go
i felt a funeral m my brain
and mourners to and fro
kept treading treading  till it seemed
that sense was breaking through
and when they all were seated
a service like a drum
kept beating  beating  till i thought
my mind was going numb
and then i heard them lift a box
and creak across my soul
with those same boots of lead again
then space  began to toll
as all the heavens were a bell
and bemg but an ear
and i and silence some strange race
wrecked solitary here
and then a plank in reason broke
and i dropped down and down
and hit a world at every plunge
and fmished knowing  then
tis so appalling  it exhilarates
so over horror it half captivates
the soul stares after it secure
a sepulchre fears frost no more
to scan a ghost is faint
but grapplmg conquers it
how easy torment now
suspense kept sawing so
the truth is bald and cold
but that will hold
if any are not sure
we show them prayer
but we who know
stop hoping now
looking at death is dying
just let go the breath
and not the pillow at your cheek
so slumbereth
others can wrestle
yours is done
and so of woe bleak dreaded  come
it sets the fright at liberty
and terrors free
gay ghastly holiday
how note less men and plelads stand
until a sudden sky
reveals the fact that one is rapt
forever from the eye
members of the invisible
existing while we stare
in leagueless opportunity
ertakeless as the air
why didnt we detain them
the heavens with a stiule
sweep by our disappointed heads
without a syllable
a mien to move a queen
half child  half heroine
an orleans in the eye
that puts its manner by
for humbler company
when none are near
even a tear
its frequent visitor
a bonnet like a duke
and yet a wrens peruke
were not so shy
of goer by
and hands  so slight
they would elate a sprite
with merriment
a voice that alters  low
and on the ear can go
like let of snow
or shift supreme
as tone of realm
on subjects diadem
too small  to fear
too distant  to endear
and so men compromise
and just  revere
the drop that wrestles in the sea
forgets her own locality
as i  toward thee
she knows herself an incense small
yet small she sighs  if all is all
how larger be
the ocean  smiles  at her conceit
but she forgetting amphitrite
pleads  me
the robins my criterion for tune
because i grow  where robins do
but were i cuckoo born
d swear by him
the ode familiar  rules the noon
the buttercups my vvhim for bloom
because were orchard sprung
but were i britain born
d daisies spurn
none but the nutoctober fit
because through dropping it
the seasons bit  im taught
without the snows tableau
winter were he  to me
because i see  new englandly
the queen discerns hke me
provincially

that after horror  that twas us
that passed the mouldenng pier
just as the granite crumb let go
our savior by a hair
a second more had dropped too deep
for fisherman to plumb
the very profile of the thought
puts recollection numb
the possibihty  to pass
without a moments bell
into conjectures presence
is like a face of steel
that suddenly looks into ours
with a metallic grin
the cordiality of death
who drills his welcome in
a clock stopped
not the mantels
genevas farthest skill
cant put the puppet bowing
that just now dangled stiil
an awe came on the trinket l
the figures hunched with pain
then quivered out of declmals
into degreeless noon
it w not stir for doctors
this pendulum of snow
this shopman importunes it
while cool  concernless no
nods from the gilded pomters
nods from the seconds shm
decades of arrogance between
the dial life
and him

im nobodyl who are you
are you  nobody  too
then theres a pair of us l
dont tell theyd advertise  you know
how dreary  to be  somebody
how public like a frog
to tell ones name  the livelong june
to an admiring bog
i know some lonely houses off the road
a robberd like the look of
wooden barred
and wmdows hanging low
inviting to
a portico
where two could creep
one  hand the tools
the other peep
to make sure alls asleep
old fashioned eyes
not easy to surprise
how orderly the kltchend look by night
with just a clock
but they could gag the tick
and mice wont bark
and so the walls  dont tell
nonewill
a pair of spectacles ajar just stlr
an almanacs aware
was it the mat  winked
or a nervous star
the moon  slides down the stair
to see whos there
there plunder  where
tankard or spoon
earrmg  or stone
a watch  some ancient brooch
to match the grandmama
staid sleepmg  there
day  rattles  too
stealths  slow
the sun has got as far
as the third sycamore
screams chanticleer
whos there
and echoes  trains away
sneer  where
while the old couple just astir
fancy the sunrise left the door ajar
c   ll
of bronze  and blaze
the north  tonight
so adequate  it forms
so preconcerted with itself
so distant  to alarms
an unconcern so sovereign
to u mverse or me
infects my simple spirit
with tamts of majesty
till i take vaster attitudes
and strut upon my stem
disdammg men and oxygen
for arrogance of them
my splendors are menageue
but their competeless show
will entertain the centuries
when i am long ago
an island in dishonored grass
whom none but beetles  know
how the old mountains dnp with sunset
how the hemlocks burn
how the dun brake is draped in cinder
by the wizard sun
how the old steeples hand the scarlet
till the ball is full
have i the lip of the flamingo
that i dare to tell
then how the fire ebbs like billows
touching all the grass
with a departing  sapphire  feature
as a duchess passed
how a small dusk crawls on the village
till the houses blot
and the odd flambeau no men carry
glllnmer on the street
how it is night  m nest and kennel
and where was the wood
just a dome of abyss is bowmg
into solitude
these are the vlslons flitted guido
titian  never told
domenichino dropped his pencil
paralyzed with gold
if your nerve deny you
go above your nerve
he can lean agamst the grave
if he fear to swerve
thats a steady posture
never any bend
held of those brass arms
best giant made
if your soul seesaw
lift the flesh door
the poltroon wants oxygen
nothingmore
i got so i could take his name
without  tremendous gam
that stopsensation  on my soul
and thunder  in the room
i got so i could walk across
that angle in the floor
where he turned so and r turned  how
and all our sinew tore
i got so i could stir the box
in which his letters grew
without that forcing in my breath
as staples  dnven through
could dimly recollect a grace
i thmk they call it god
renowned to ease extremity
when formula had failed
and shape my hands
petitions way
tho ignorant of a word
that ordination  utters
my busmess with the cloud
if any power behmd it be
not subject to despair
it care in some remoter way
for so minute affair
as misery
itself too vast for interruptmg  mole

the doomed  regard the sunrise
with different delight
because  when next it burns abroad
they doubt to witness it
the man  to die  tomorrow
harks for the meadow bird
because its music stirs the axe
that clamors for his head
joyful to whom the sunrise
precedes enamored  day
joyful for whom the meadow bird
has ought but elegy
unto hke story  trouble has enticed me
how kinsmen fell
brothers and sister  who preferred the glory
and their young will
bent to the scaffold or in dungeons  chanted
till gods full time
when they let go the ignommy  smilmg
and shame went still
unto guessed crests by moaning fancy leads me
worn fair
by heads rejected  in the lower country
of honors there
such spirit makes her perpetual mention
that i  grown bold
step martial  at my crucifixion
as trumpets  roiled
feet small as mine  have malched in revolution
firm to the drum
hands  not so stout  hoisted them  in witness
when speech went numb
let me not shame their sublime deportments
dnlled brigh t
beckoning  etruscan invitation
toward light
one year ago  jots what
god  spell the word i  cant
wast grace not that
wast glory thatwill do
spell slower  glory
such anniversary shall be
sometimesnot oftenin etemity
when farther parted than the common woe
look  feed upon each others faces  so
in doubtful meal if it be possible
their banquets true
i tasted  careless  then
i did not know the wine
carne once a world  did you
oh had you told me so
this thirst would blister  easier  now
you said it hurt you  most
mine  was an acorns breast
and could not know how fondness grew
in shaggier vest
perhaps  i couldnt
but had you looked in
a giant  eye to eye with you had been
no acorn  then
so  twelve months ago
we breathed
then dropped the air
which bore it best
was this  the patientest
because it was a child you know
and could not value  air
if to be elder  mean most pain
im old enough today im certain  then
as old as thee  how soon
one  birthday more  or ten
let me  choose
ah sir none
its like the light
a fashionless delight
its like the bee
a dateless  melody
its like the woods
private  like the breeze
phraseless  yet it stirs
the proudest trees
its like the mornmg
best  when its done
and the everlasting clocks
chime  noon
alone i cannot be
for hosts  do visit me
recordless company
who baffie key
they have no robes nor names
no almanacs  nor chmes
but general homes
like gnomes
their coming may be known
by couriers within
their going  is not
for theyre never gone
your riches  taught me  poverty
myself  a millionaire
in little wealths as girls could boast
till broad as buenos ayre
you drifted your dominions
a different peru
and i esteemed all poverty
for lifes estate with you
of mmes i little know  myself
but just the names of gems
the colors of the commonest
and scarce of diadems
so much that did i meet the queen
her glory i should know
but this must be a different wealth
to miss it  beggars so
im sure tis india  all day
to those who look on you
without a stmt  without a blame
might i  but be the jew
im sure it is golconda
beyond my power to deem
to have a smile for mme  each day
how better than a gem
at least it solaces to know
that there exists  a gold
altho i prove it just in time
its distance  to behold
its far  far treasure to surmise
and estimate the pearl
that slipped my simple fingers through
while just a girl at school
means mk
m ornmg            ii mg  to th e farmer
dawn  to the t eneriffe
dice  to the maid
morning means just risk  to the lover
just revelation  to the beloved
epicures  date a breakfast  by it
brides  an apocalypse
worlds  a flood
faintgoing lives  their lapse from sighing
faith  the experiment of our lord
i reason earth is short
and anguish  absolute
and many hurt
but what of that
i reason we could die
the best vitality
cannot excel decay
but what of that
i reason that  heaven
somehow it will be even
some new equatlon given
but what of that
like some old fashioned miracle
when summertime is done
seems summers recollection
and the affaus of june
as infimte traditlon
as cmderellas bays
or little john  of lincoln green
or blue beards galleries
her bees have a fictitious hum
her blossoms like a dream
elate us  till we almost weep
so plausible  they seem
her memories like strains  review
when orchestra is dumb
the vlohn in baize replaced
and ear  and heaven  numb
the soul selects her own society
then  shuts the door
to her divine majority
present no more
unmoved  she notes the chariots  pausing
at her low gate
unmoved  an emperor be kneeling
upon her mat
ive known her  from an ample nation
chooseone
then  close the valves of her attention
like stone
the day came slow  till five oclock
then sprang before the hills
like hmdered rubies  or the light
a sudden musket  spills
the purple could not keep the east
the sunrise shook abroad
like breadths of topaz  packed a night
the lady just unrolled
the happy winds  their timbrels took
the birds  in docile rows
arranged themselves around their prince
the wind  is prince of those
the orchard sparkled like a jew
howmightytwas to be
a guest m this stupendous place
the parlor  of the day
the difference between despair
and fear  is like the one
between the instant of a wreck
and when the wreck has been
the mmd is smooth  no motion
contented as the eye
upon the forehead of a bust
that knows  it cannot see
the souls superior instants
occur to her  alone
when friend  and earths occasion
have infimte withdrawn
or she  herself  ascended
to too remote a height
for lower recognition
than her omnipotent
this mortal abolition
is seldom  but as fair
as apparition  subject
to autocratic air
eternitys disclosure
to favorites  a few
of the colossal substance
of immortality
the one who could repeat the summer day
were greater than itself  though he
minutest of mankind should be
and he  could reproduce the sun
at period of going down
the lingering  and the stain  i mean
when onent have been outgrown
and occident  become unknown

was saying to a friend
mme  is the more convenient
to carry in the hand
for largest womans heart i knew
tis little i can do
and yet the largest womans heart
could hold an arrow  too
and so instructed by my own
i tenderer turn me to
give little anguish
lives will fret
give avalanches
and theyll slant
straighten look cautious for their breath
but make no syllable like death
who only shows his marble disc
sublimer sort  than speech
it sifts from leaden sieves
it powders all the wood
it fills with alabaster wool
the wrmkles of the road
it makes an even face
of mountain and of plain
unbroken forehead from the east
unto the east again
it reaches to the fence
it wraps it rail by rail
till it is lost in fleeces
it deals celestial vail
to stump and stack  and stern
a summers empty room
acres of joints where harvests were
recordless but for them
it rufres wrists of posts
as ankles of a queen
then stills its al tisans like ghosts
denying they have been
her  last poems
poets  ended
silver  perished  with her tongue
not on record  bubbled other
flute  or woman
so divine
not unto its summer  morning
robin  uttered half the tune
gushed too free for the adoring
from the angloflorentine
late  the praise
tis dull conferrmg
on the head too high to crown
diadem  or ducal showing
be its grave  sufficient sign
nought  that we  no poets kinsman
suffocate  with easy woe
what and if ourself a bridegroom
put her down  in italy
i should have been too glad i see
too lifted  for the scant degree
of lifes penurious round
my little circuit would have shamed
this new circumference  have blamed
the homelier time behind
i should have been too saved  i see
too rescued  fear too dim to me
that i could spell the prayer
i knew so perfect  yesterday
that scalding one  sabachthani
recited fluent  here
earth would have been too much  i see
and heaven  not enough for me
i should have had the joy
without the fear  to justify
the palm  without the calvary

when they do not die
fainter leaves  to further seasons
dumbly testify
we  who have the souls
die oftener  not so vitally
he fumbles at your soul
as players at the keys
before they drop full music on
he stuns you by degrees
prepares your brittle nature
for the ethereal blow
by fainter hammers  further heard
then nearer  then so slow
your breath has time to straighten
your brain  to bubble cool
deals  one  imperial thunderbolt
that scalps your naked soul
when winds take forests in their paws
the universe  is still
the wind didnt come from the orchard  today
further than that
nor stop to play with the hay
nor joggle a hat
hes a transitive fellow  very
rely on that
if he leave a bur at the door
we know he has climbed a fir
but the fir is where  declare
were you ever there
if he brings odors of clovers
and that is his business  not ours
then he has been with the mowers
whetting away the hours
to sweet pauses of hay
his way  of a june day
if he fling sand and pebble
little boys hats  and stubble
with an occasional steeple
and a hoarse get out of the way i say
whod be the fool to stay
would you say
would you be the fool to stay
just so  jesus  raps
he  doesnt weary
last  at the knocker
and first  at the bell
then  on divinest tiptoe  standing
might he but spy the ladys soul
when he  retires
chilled  or weary
it will be atiiple time for  me
patient  upon the steps  untzl then
heart i am knocking low at thee
ill tell you how the sun rose
a ribbon at a time
the steeples swam m amethyst
the news hke squirrels ran
the hills untied their bonnets
the bobolmks  begun
then i said softly to myself
that must have been the sun
but how he set  i know not
there seemed a purple stlle
that httle yellow boys and glrls
were chmbing all the whlle
till when they reached the other slde
a dommie m gray
put gently up the evenmg bars
and led the flock away
the nearest dream recedes  unrealized
the heaven we chase
like the june bee  before the school boy
invites the race
stoops  to an easy clover
dips  evades  teases  deploys
then  to the royal clouds
lifts his light pmnace
heedless of the boy
staring  bewildered  at the mocking sky
homesick for steadfast honey
ah the bee hies not
that brews that rare variety
we play at paste
till qualified for pearl
then drop the paste
and deem ourself a fool
the shapes  though  were similar
and our new hands
learned gemtactlcs
practicing sands
of all the sounds despatched abroad
theres not a charge to me
like that old measure in the boughs
that phraseless melody
the wind does  working like a hand
whose fingers comb the sky
then quiver down  with tufts of tune
permitted gods and me
inheritance it is to us
beyond the art to earn
beyond the trait to take away
by robber since the gam
is gotten not of fingers
and mner than the bone
hid golden for the whole of days
and even in the urn
i cannot vouch the merry dust
do not arise and play
in some odd fashion of its own
some quainter holiday
when wmds go round and round m bands
and thrum upon the door
and birds take places overhead
to bear them orchestra
i crave him grace of summer boughs
if such an outcast be
who never heard that beshless chant
rise  solemn  on the tree
as if some caravan of sound
off deserts in the sky
had parted rank
then knit and swept
in seamless company
there came a day at summers full
entirely for me
i thought that such were for the samts
where resurrections  be
the sun as common went abroad
the bowers accustomed blew
as if no soul the solstice passed
that maketh all things new
the time was scarce profaned by speech
the symbol of a word
was needless as at sacrament
the wardrobe  of our lord
each was to each the sealed church
permitted to commune this  time
lest we too awkward show
at supper of the lamb
the hours slid fast  as hours will
clutched tight by greedy hands
so faces on two decks look back
bound to opposing lands
and so when all the time had leaked
without external sound
each bound the others crucifix
we gave no other bond
sufficient troth that we shall nse
deposed  at length the grave
to that new marriage
justifiedthrough calvaries of love
c zz
as if i asked a common alms
and in my wondering hand
a stranger pressed a kingdom
and i bewildered stand
as if i asked the onent
had it for me a morn
and it should lift its purple dikes
and shatter me with dawn
some keep the sabbath gomg to church
i keep it staying at home
with a bobolink for a chorister
and an orchard for a dome
some keep the sabbath in surplice
i just wear my wings
and instead of tolling the bell for church
our little sexton  sings
god preaches a noted clergyman
and the sermon is never long
so mstead of gettmg to heaven at last
im going all along
of t nbulatlon these are they
denoted by the white
the spangled gowns a lesser rank
of victors  designate
all these  did conquer
but the ones who overcame most times
wear nothing commoner than snow
no ornament but palms
surrender is a sort unknown
on this supenor s
defeat an outgrown anguish
remembered as the mile
our panting ankle barely passed
when night devoured the road
but westood whispering in the house
and all we saidwas saved
c rr
i cannot dance upon my toes
no man instructed me
but oftentimes among my mmd
a glee possesseth me
that had i ballet knowledge
would put itself abroad
in pirouette to blanch a troupe
or lay a prima mad
and though i had no gown of gauze
no ringlet to my hair
nor hopped to audienceslike birds
one claw upon the air
nor tossed my shape in eider balls
nor rolled on wheels of snow
till i was out of sight in sound
the house encore me so
nor any know i know the art
i mentlon  easy  here
nor any placard boast me
its full as opera
before i got my eye put out
i liked as well to see
as other creatures that have eyes
and know no other way
but were it told to me today
that i might have the sky
for mine  i tell you that my heart
would split for size of me
the meadows  mine
the mountains  mine
all forests  stintless stars
as much of noon as i could take
between my finite eyes
the motions of the dipping birds
the mornings amber road
for mine  to look at when i liked
the news would strike me dead
so safer  guess  with just my soul
upon the window pane
where other creatures put their eyes
incautious  of the sun
a bird came down the walk
he did not know i saw
he bit an angleworm in halves
and ate the fellow raw
and then he drank a dew
from a convement grass
and then hopped sidewise to the wall
to let a beetle pass
he glanced with rapid eyes
that hurried all around
they looked like frightened beads i thought
he stirred his velvet head
like one in danger cautious
i offered him a crumb
and he unrolled his feathers
and rowed him softer home
than oars divide the ocean
too silver for a seam
or butterflies off banks of noon
leap plashless as they swim
so glad we are  a strangerd deem
twas sorry that we were
for where the holiday should be
there publishes a tear
nor how ourselves be justified
since grief and joy are done
so similar  an optizan
could not decide between
the jugglers hat her country is
the mountam gorsethe bees
while asters
on the hill
their everlastmg fashions  set
and covenant gentians  fnlll
there are two ripenings  one  of sight
whose forces spheric wind
until the velvet product
drop spicy to the ground
a homelier maturing
a process in the bur
that teeth of frosts alone disclose
in far october air
the grass so little has to do
a sphere of simple green
with only butterflies to brood
and bees to entertain
and stir all day to pretty tunes
the breezes fetch along
and hold the sunshine in its lap
and bow to every thing
and thread the dews all night like pearis
and make itself so fine
a duchess were too common
for such a noticing
and even when it dies  to pass
in odors so divme
like lowly spices lam to sleep
or spikenards perishmg
and then in sovereign barns to dwell
and dream the days away
the grass so little has to do
i wish i were a hay
all the letters i can write
are not fair as this
syllables of velvet
sentences of plush
depths of ruby undrained
hid lip for thee
play it were a humming bird
and just sipped  me
tis not that dymg hurts us so
tis livinghurts us more
but dying  is a different way
a kind behind the door
the southern custom  of the bird
that ere the frosts are due
accepts a better latitude
we  are the birds  that stay
the shiverers round farmers doors
for whose reluctant crumb
we stipulate  tlll pitying snows
persuade our feathers home
the face i carry with me last
when i go out of time
to take my rankbyin the west
that face  will just be thme
ill hand it to the angel
that  sir  was my degree
in kingdoms  you have heard the raised
refer toposslbly
hell take it  scan it  step aside
returnwith such a crown
as gabriel never capered at
and beg me put it on
and then  hell turn me round and round
to an admiring sky
as one that bore her masters name
sufficient royalty
i know a place where summer strives
wlth such a practised frost
she  each year leads her daisies back
recordmg briefly  lost
but when the south wind stirs the pools
and struggles in the lanes
her heart misgives her for her vow
and she pours soft refrains
into the lap of adamant
and spices  and the dew
that stiffens quletly to quartz
upon her amber shoe
i know that he exists
somewhere  in silence
he has hid his rare life
from our gross eyes
tis an instants play
tis a fond ambush
just to make bliss
earn her own surpnse
butshould the play
prove piercmg earnest
should the glee  glaze
in deathsstiffstare
would not the fun
look too expensive l
would not the jest
have crawled too far l
i tend my flowers for thee
bnght absentee
my fuchsias coral seams
ripwhile the sowerdreams
geraniums  tint  and spot
low daisies  dot
my cactussplits her beard
to show her throat
carnations  tip their spice
and bees  pick up
a hyacinth  i hid
puts out a ruffled head
and odors fall
from basks  so smail
you marvel how they held
globe roses  break their satm bake
upon my garden boor
yet  thou  not there
i had as lief they bore
no crimsonmore
thy bower  be gay
her lord  away
it ill becometh me
ill dwell in calyxgray
how modestlyalway
thy daisy
draped for thee
is bliss then such abyss
i must not put my foot amiss
for fear i spoil my shoe
id rather suit my foot
than save my boot
for yet to buy another pair
is possible
at any store
but bliss is sold just once
the patent lost
none buy it any more
say foot decide the point
the lady cross or not
verdict for boot
after great pam a formal feehng comes
the nerves sit ceremomous like tombs
the stiff heart questions was it he that bore
and yesterday or centunes before
the feet mechamcal go round
of ground or air or ought
a wooden way
regardless grown
a quartz contentment like a stone
this is the hour of lead
remembered if outlived
as freezmg persons recollect the snow
first  chlll then stupor  then the letting go
it will be summereventually
ladies  with parasols
sauntering gentlemenwith canes
and little girlswith dolls
will tmt the pallid landscape
as twere a bright bouquet
tho drifted deep in parian
the village lies  today
the lilacs  bending many a year
will sway with purple load
the bees  will not despise the tune
their forefathers  have hummed
the wild roseredden in the bog
the aster  on the hill
her everlasting fashion  set
and covenant gentians  frill
till summer folds her miracle
as women  do  their gown
or priests  adjust the symbols
when sacrament  is done
my reward for being was this
my premium  my bliss
an admiralty less
a sceptre  penniless
and realms  just dross
when thrones accost my hands
with me miss me
ill unroll thee
dommions dowerless  beside tlus grace
election  vote
the ballots of eternity will show just that
twas the old  road  through pain
that unfrequented  one
with many a tumand thorn
that stops  at heaven
this  was the town  she passed
there  where she  rested last
then  stepped more fast
the little tracksclose prest
then  not so swift
slow  slow  as feet did weary  grow
then  stopped  no other track
wait look her little book
the leaf  at love  turned back
her very hat
and this worn shoe just fits the track
herself  though  fled
another bed  a short one
women maketonight
in chambels bright
too out of sight  though
for our hoarse good night
to touch her head

funnyto be a century
and see the people  gomg by

so dainty of publicity

not probable  the barest chance
a smile too few  a word too much
and far from heaven as the rest
the soul so close on paradise
what if the bird from journey far
confused by sweets  as mortals  are
forget the secret of his wing
and perish  bu t a bough between
oh groping feet
oh phantom queen
when night is almost done
and sunrise grows so near
that we can touch the spaces
its time to smooth the hair
and get the dimples ready
and wonder we could care
for that old  faded midnight
that frightened  but an hour
i dreaded that first robin so
but he is mastered now
im some accustomed to him grown
he hurts a little though
i thought if i could only live
till that first shout got by
not all pianos in the woods
had power to mangle me
i dared not meet the daffodils
for fear their yellow gown
would pierce me with a fashion
so foreign to my own
i wished the grass would hurry
sowhen twas time to see
hed be too tall the tallest one
could stretch  to look at me
i could not bear the bees should come
i wished theyd stay away
in those dim countries where they go
what word had they for me
theyre here though not a creature failed
no blossom stayed away
in gentle deference to me
the queen of calvary
each one salutes me as he goes
and i my childish plumes
lift in bereaved acknowledgment
of their unthmkmg drums
i had the glory  tha t will do
an honor thought can turn her to
when lesser fames invite
with one long nay
bliss early shape
deforming  dwindling  gulfing up
times possibility
they leave us with the infinite
but heis not a man
his fingers are the size of fists
his fists the size of men
and whom he foundeth with his arm
as himmaleh shall stand
gibraltars everlasting shoe
poised lightly on his hand
so trust him comrade
you for you and i for you and me
eternity is ample
and quick enough if true
i felt my life with both my hands
to see if it was there
i held my spirit to the glass
to prove it possibler
i turned my being round and round
and paused at every pound
to ask the owners name
for doubt that i should know the sound
i judged my features  jarred my halr
i pushed my dimples by and waited
if they  twmkled back
conviction might of me
i told myself take courage friend
that  was a former time
but we might learn to like the heaven
as well as our old home l
perhaps i asked too large
i take  no less than skies
for earths grow thick as
berries in my native town
my basket holds  just  firmaments
those  dangle easy  on my arm
but smaller bundles  cram
a happy lip  breaks sudden
it doesnt state you how
it contemplatedsmiling
just consummated  now
but this one wears its merriment
so patient  like a pain
fresh gilded  to elude the eyes
unqualified to scan
from cocoon forth a butterfly
as lady from her door
emerged  a summer afternoon
repairing everywhere
without design  that i could trace
except to stray abroad
on miscellaneous enterpnse
the clovers  understood
her pretty parasol be seen
contractmg in a field
where men made hay
then struggling hard
with an opposing cloud
where parties  phantom as herself
to nowhereseemed to go
in purposeless circumference
as twere a tropic show
and notwithstanding beethat wolked
and flower that zealous blew
thls audience of idleness
disdained them from the sky
till sundown crept  a steady tide
and men that made the hay
and afternoon  and butterfly
extinguished  in the sea
tis opposites  entice
deformed men  ponder grace
bright fires  the blanketless
the lost  days face
the blind  esteem it be
enough estate  to see
the captive  strangles new
for deemmg  beggars  play
to lack  enamor thee
tho the divmity
be only
the day that i was crowned
was like the other days
until the coronation came
and thentwas otherwise
as carbon in the coal
and carbon in the gem
are one  and yet the former
were dull for diadem
i rose and all was plain
but when the day declined
myself and it in majesty
were equally  adorned
the grace that i  was chose
tome  surpassed the crown
that was the witness for the grace
twas even that twas mine
god is a distantstately lover
woos as he states us  by his son
verily a vicarious courtship
miles and priscilla were such an one
bu t lest the soul like fair tpriscilla
choose the envoy  and spurn the groom

if any smk assure that this now standmg
failed like themselves  and conscious that it rose
grew by the fact and not the understanding
how weakness passed  or force  arose
tell that the worst is easy in a moment
dread but the whizzing before the ball
when the ball enters enters silence
dyingannuls the power to kill
i gamed it so
by climbmg slow
by catching at the twigs that grow
between the bliss  and me
it hung so high
as well the sky
attempt by strategy
i said i gained it
this  was all
look how i clutch it
lest it fall
and i a pauper go
unfitted by an instants grace
for the contented  beggars face
i wore  an hour ago
death sets a thing significant
the eye had hurried by
except a perished creature
entreat us tenderly
to ponder little workmanships
in crayon or in wool
with this was last her fingers chd
industrious until
the thimble weighed too heavy
the stitches stopped  themselves
and then twas put among the dust
upon the closet shelves
a book i have  a friend gave
whose pencil here and there
had notched the place that pleased him
at rest  his fingers are
nowwhen i readi read not
for mterruptmg tears
obhterate the etchings
too costly for repairs
what i can do  i will
though it be little as a daffodil
that i cannot  must be
unknown to possibility
it struck me  every day
the lightning was as new
as if the cloud that instant slit
and let the fire through
it burned me  in the night
it blistered to my dream
it sickened fresh upon my sight
with every morn that came
l thought that stormwas brief
the maddestquickest by
but nature lost the date of this
and left it in the sky
i went to thank her
but she slept
her bed  a funneled stone
with nosegays at the head and foot
that travellers  had thrown
who went to thank her
but she slept
twas short  to cross the sea
to look upon her like  alive
but turning backtwas slow
the morning after woe
tis frequently the way
surpasses all that rose before
for utter jubilee
as nature did not care
and piled her blossoms on
and further to parade a joy
her victim stared upon
the birds declaim their tunes
pronouncing every word
like hammers  did they know they fell
like litanies of lead
on here and there  a creature
theyd modify the glee
to fit some crucifixal clef
some key of calvary
dare you see a soul at the white heat
then crouch within the door
redis the fires common tmt
but when the vivid ore
has vanquished flames conditions
it quivers from the forge
without a color but the light
of unanointed blaze
least village has its blacksmith
whose anvils even ring
stands symbol for the finer forge
that soundless tugs  within
refimng these impatient ores
with hammer and with blaze
until the designated light
repudiate the forge
although i put away his life
an ornament too grand
for forehead low as mine to wear
this might have been the hand
that sowed the flower he preferred
or smoothed a homely pain
or pushed the pebble from his path
or played his chosen tune
on lute the leastthe latest
but just his ear could know
that whatsoeer delighted it
i never would let go
the foot to bear his errand
a little boot i know
would leap abroad like antelope
with just the grant to do
his weariest commandment
a sweeter to obey
than hide and seek
or skip to flutes
or all day chase the bee
your servant sir will weary
the surgeon will not come
the world will have its ownto do
the dust will vex your fame
the cold will force your tightest door
some february day
but say my apron bring the sticks
to make your cottage gay
that i may take that promise
to paradise with me
to teach the angels avarice
you sir taught firstto me
over and over like a tune
the recollection plays
drums off the phantom battlements
comets of paradise
snatches from baptized generations
cadences too grand
but for the justified processions
at the lords right hand
how sick  to wait  m any place  but thine
i knew last night  when someone tried to twme
thmkingperhapsthat i looked tlredor alone
or breaking  almost  with unspoken pain
and i turned ducal
that right  was thine
one port  suffices  for a brig like mzne
ours be the tossing  wild though the sea
rather than a mooring  unshared by thee
ours be the cargo  unladen  here
rather than thespicy sles
and thou  not there
she lay as if at play
her life had leaped away
intendmg to return
but not so soon
her merry arms half dropt
as if for lull of sport
an instant had forgot
the trick to start
her dancing eyes ajar
as if their owner were
still sparkling through
for fun  at you
her morning at the door
devising i am sure
to force her sleep
so light  so deep
heaven is so far of the mind
that were the mind dissolved
the site  of it  by architect
could not again be proved
tis vast  as our capacity
as fair  as our idea
to him of adequate desire
no further tis than here
a precious  mouldering pleasure  tis
to meet an antique book
in just the dress his century wore
a pnvilege  i think
his venerable hand to take
and warming in our own
a passage back  or two  to make
to times when hewas young
his quaint opimons  to inspect
his thought to ascertain
on themes concern our mutual mind
the literature of man
what interested scholars  most
what competioons ran
when plato  was a certainty
and sophocles  a man
when sappho  was a living girl
and beatrice wore
the gown that dante  deified
facts centuries before
he traverses  familiar
as one should come to town
and tell you all your dreams  were true
he lived  where dreams were born
his presence is enchantment
you beg hlm not to go
old volumes shake therr vellum heads
and tantalize  just so
i know lives i could miss
wlthout a misery
otherswhose instants wanting
would be eternity
the lasta scanty number
twould scarcely fill a two
the firsta gnats horizon
could easily outgrow
im saying every day
if i should be a queen tomorrow
id do this way
and so i deck a little
if it be i wake a bourbon
none on me bend supercilious
with this was she
begged in the market place
yesterday
court is a stately place
ive heard men say
so i loop my apron against the majesty
with bright pins of buttercup
that not too plain
rank  overtake me
and perch my tongue
on twigs of singmg  rather high
but this might be my brief term
to quallfy
put from my simple speech all plam word
take other accents as such i heard
though but for the clicket  just
and but for the bee
not in all the meadow
one accost me
better to be ready
than did next morn
meet me in aragon
myoid gownon
and the surpnsed air
rustics  wear
summoned  unexpectedly
to exeter
i went to heaven
twas a small town
lit  with a ruby
lathed  with down
stiller  than the fields
at the full dew
beautiful as pictures
no man drew
people like the moth

the angle of a landscape
that every time i wake
between my curtam and the wall
upon an ample crack
like a venetian  waiting
accosts my open eye
is just a bough of apples
held slanting m the sky
the pattern of a chimney
the forehead of a hill
sometimesa vanes forefinger
but thats  occasional
the seasons  shift  my picture
upon my emerald bough
i wake  to find no  emeralds
thendiamondswhich the snow
from polar caskets  fetched me
the chimney  and the hill
and just the steeples finger
these  never sur at all
of course  i prayed
and did god care
he cared as much as on the air
a birdhad stamped her foot
and cried give me
my reason  life
i had not had  but for yourself
twere better charity
to leave me in the atoms tomb
merry and nought and gay and numb
than this smart misery
to lose ones faith  surpass
the loss of an estate
because estates can be
replenished  faith cannot
inherited with llfe
behef but oncecan be
anmhllate a single clause
and beings  beggary
i saw no way  the heavens were stitched
i felt the columns close
the earth reversed her hemispheres
i touched the universe
and back it slid  and i alone
a speck upon a ball
went out upon circumference
beyond the dip of bell
rehearsal to ourselves
of a withdrawn delight
affords a bliss like murder
omnipotent  acute
we will not drop the dirk
because we love the wound
the dirk commemorate  itself
remind us that we died
there is a flower that bees prefer
and butterflies  desire
to gain the purple democrat
the humming bird  aspire
and whatsoever insect pass
a honey bear away
proportioned to his several dearth
and her  capacity
her face be rounder than the moon
and ruddier than the gown
of orchis in the pasture
or rhododendron  worn
she doth not wait for june
before the world be green
her sturdy little countenance
against the wind  be seen
contending with the grass
near kinsman to herself
for privilege of sod and sun
sweet litigants for life
and when the hills be full
and newer fashions blow
doth not retract a single spice
for pang of jealousy
her public  be the noon
her providence  the sun
her progress  by the bee  proclaimed
in sovereign  swerveless tune
the bravest  of the host
surrendering  the last
nor even of defeat  aware
when cancelled by the frost
a secret told
ceases to be a secret  then
a secret  kept
thatcan appal but one
better of it  continual be afraid
than it
and whom you told it to  beside
for death  or rather
for the thmgs twould buy

the things that death will buy
are room
escape from circumstances
and a name

how deaths gifts may compare
we know not

exhilaration  is within
there can no outer wine
so royally intoxicate

of how many be

the sweetest heresy received
that man and woman know
each others convert
though the faith accommodate but two
the churches are so frequent
the ritual so small
the grace so unavoidable
to fail is infidel
take your heaven further on
this  to heaven divine has gone
had you earlier blundered in
possibly een you had seen
an eternityput on
now  to ring a door beyond
is the utmost of your hand
to the skies  apologize
nearer to your courtesies
than this sufferer pohte
dressed to meet you

theres been a death in the opposite house
as lately as today
i know it by the numb look
such houses have  alway
the neighbors rustle in and ou t
the doctordrives away
a window opens like a pod
abrupt  mechanically
somebody rings a mattress out
the children hurry by
they wonder if it died  on that
i used to  when a boy
the mmister  goes stiffiy in
as if the house were his
and he owned all the mourners  now
and little boys  besides
and then the milliner  and the man
of the appalling trade
to take the measure of the house
therell be that dark parade
of tassels  and of coaches  soon
its easy as a sign
the intuition of the news
in just a country town
its comingthe postponeless creature
it gams the block  and now  it gams the door
chooses its latch from all the other fastemngs
enterswith a you know mesir
simple salute  and certain recogmtion
bold  were it enemy  brief  were it fnend
dresses each house in crape and lcicle
and carries one  out of it  to god
a visitor in marl
who influences flowers
till they are orderly as busts
and elegant  as glass
who visits in the night
and just before the sun
concludes his glistening interview
caresses  and is gone
but whom his fingers touched
and where his feet have run
and whatsoever mouth he kissed
is as it had not been
through the dark sod  as education
the lily passes sure
feels her white foot  no trepidation
her faith  no fear
afterward  in the meadow
swmging her beryl bell
the moldlife  all forgotten  now
in ecstasy  and deli
did our best moment last
twould supersede the heaven
a few  and they by risk  procure
so this sort are not given
except as stimulants  in
cases of despair
or stupor  the reserve
these heavenly moments are
a grant of the divine
that certam as it comes
withdraws  and leaves the dazzled soul
in her unfurnished rooms
twas love  not me
oh punish  pray
the real one dled for thee
just hlm  not me
such gmlt  to love thee  most
doom it beyond the rest
forgive it last
twas base as jesus  most
let justlce not mlstake
we two looked so alike
which was the gmlty sake
twas loves now stnke
reverse cannnot befall
that fine prospenty
whose sources ale mteriol
as soon  adverslty
a diamond  overtake
in far  bolivian ground
mlsfortune hath no implement
could mar it  if it found
there is a languor of the life
more imminent than pain
tis pains successor when the soul
has suffered all it can
a drowsiness  diffuses
a dimness like a fog
envelops consciousness
as mists  obliterate a crag
the surgeon  does not blanch  at pain
his habitis severe
but tell him that it ceased to feel
the creature lymg there
and he will tell you  skill is late
a mightier than he
has mimstered before hlm
theres no vitality
when diamonds are a legend
and diadems  a tale
i brooch and earrings for myself
do sow and raise for sale
and tho im scarce accounted
my art a summer dayhad patrons
once  it was a queen
and once  a butterfly
i had not minded  walls
were universe  one rock
and far i heard his silver call
the other side the block
id tunnel till my groove
pushed sudden thro to his
then my face take her recompense
the looking in his eyes
but tis a single hair
a filament  a law
a cobwebwove in adamant
a battlement  of straw
a limit like the veil
unto the ladys face
but every mesh  a cltadel
and dragonsm the crease
a house upon the height
that wagon never reached
no dead were ever earned down
no peddlers cart approached
whose chimney never smoked
whose wmdowsnight and morn
caught sunrise first  and sunset last
then  held an empty pane
whose fate  conjecture knew
no other neighbor  did
and what it waswe never hsped
because he  never told

a tongue  to tell him i am true
its fee  to be of gold
had nature  in her monstrous house
a smgle ragged child
to earn a mine  would run
that interdicted way
and tell himcharge thee speak it plain
that so far truth is true
and answer what i do
beginnmg with the day
that nightbegun
nay  midmght  twas
since midnight  happened  say
if once more  pardon  boy
the magnitude thou may
enlarge my message  if too vast
another lad  help thee

and his  in solid gold
say rubies if he hesitate
my message  must be told
saylast i saidwas this
that when the hills  come down
and hold no higher than the plain
my bond  have just begun
and when the heavens  disband
and deity conclude
then look for me be sure you say
least figure  on the road
what softcherubic creatures
these gentlewomen are
one would as soon assault a plush
or violate a star
such dimity convictions
a horror so refined
of freckled human nature
of deity  ashamed
its such a conunonglory
a fishermans  degree
redemption  brittle lady
be so  ashamed of thee
i payin satin cash
you did dot state  your price
a petal for a paragraph
is near as i can guess
the wmters are so short
im hardly justified
in sendmg all the birds away
and movmg mto pod
myself  for scarcely settled
the phoebes have begun
and thenits time to strike my tent
and open house  again
its mostly interruptions
my summel  is despolled
because there was a wmteronce
and all the cattle  starved
and so there was a deluge
and swept the world away
but ararats a legendnow
and no one credits noah
how many rowers fail in wood
or perish from the hill
without the privilege to know
that they are beautiful
how many cast a nameless pod
upon the nearest breeze
unconscious of the scarlet freight
it bear to other eyes
it might be lonelier
without the loneliness
im so accustomed to my fate
perhaps the otherpeace
would mterrupt the dark
and crowd the little room
too scant  by cubits  to con tam
the sacrament  of him
i am not used to hope
it might intrude upon
its sweet parade  blaspheme the place
ordamed to suffering
it might be easier
to failwith land m sight
than gam  my blue pemnsula
to perish  of delight
some work for immortality
the chiefer part for time
he  compensates  immediately
the former  checks  on fame
slow gold  but everlasting
the bullion of today
contrasted with the currency
of immortahty
a beggar  here and there
is gifted to discern
beyond the brokers insight
ones  money ones  the mine
if what we could  were what we would
cnterion  be small
it is the ultimate of talk
the impotence to t ell
unit like death for whom
true like the tomb
who tells no secret
told to him
the grave is strict
tickets admit
just two  the bearer
and the borne
and seat just one
the livmgtell
the dying but a syllable
the coy dead  none
no chatter  here  no tea
so babbler and bohea  stay there
but gravity  and expectation  and fear
a tremor just that alls not sure
they dropped like flakes
they dropped like stars
like petals from a rose
when suddenly across the june
a wind with fingers  goes
they perished in the seamless grass
no eye could find the place
but god can summon every face
on his repeailess  list
the first days night had come
and grateful that a thing
so terrible  had been endured
i told my soul to sing
she said her strings were snapt
her bow  to atoms blown
and so to mend hergave me work
until another morn
and then  a day as huge
as yesterdays in pairs
u nroiled its horror in my face
until it blocked my eyes
my brain  begun to laugh
i mumbled like a fool
and tho tis years agothat day
my brain keeps gigglingstill
and somethings odd  within
that person that i was
and this one  do not feel the same
could it be madnessthis
the color of the grave is green
the outer gravei mean
you would not know it from the field
except it own a stone
to help the fond  to find it
too infinite asleep
to stop and tell them where it is
but just a dalsy deep
the color of the grave is white
the outer grave  i mean
you would not know it from the dnfts
in wmter till the sun
has furrowed out the aisles
then  higher than the land
the httle dwellmg houses rise
where each  has left a fnend
the color of the grave wlthm
the duphcatei mean
not all the snows could make it white
not all the summersgreen
youve seen the color  maybe
upon a bonnet bound
when that you met it with before
the ferret  cannot find
i read my sentence  steadily
reviewed it with my eyes
to see that i made no mistake
in its extremest clause
the date and manner of the shame
and then the pious form
that god have mercy on the soul
the jury voted him
i made my soul familiar  with her extremity
that at the last it should not be a novel agony
but she and death acquainted
meet tranquilly as friends
salute and pass without a hint
and there the matter ends
i never fel t at home  below
and in the handsome skies
i shall not feel at home  i know
i dont like paradise
because its sundayall the tlme
and recess  never comes
and edenll be so lonesome
bright wednesday aftemoons
if god could make a visit
or ever took a nap
so not to see us  but they say
himself  a telescope
perennial beholds us
myself would run away
from hun  and holy ghost  and all
but theres the judgment day
twas like a maelstrom with a notch
that nearer every day
kept narrowing its boiling wheel
until the agony
toyed coolly with the final inch
of your delirious hem
and you dropt lost
when somethmg broke
and let you from a dream
as if a goblin with a gauge
kept measuring the hours
until you felt your second
weigh helpless in his paws
and not a sinew  stirred  could help
and sense was setting nmb
when god  remembered  and the fiend
let go then overcome
as if your sentence stood  pronounced
and you were frozen led
from dungeons luxury of doubt
to gibbets and the dead
and when the film had stitched your eyes
a creature gasped reprieve
which anguish was the utterest  then
to pensh or to live
sunset at night  is natulal
but sunset on the dawn
reverses naturemaster
so midmghtsdueat noon
eclipses be  predicted
and science bows them m
but do one face us suddenly
jehovahs watchis wrong
a murmur in the trees  to note
not loud enough  for wind
a star  not far enough to seek
nor near enough  to nnd
a long long yellow  on the lawn
a hubbub  as of feet
not audible  as ours  to us
but dapperermore sweet
a hurrying home of little men
to houses unperceived
all this  and more if i should tell
would never be believed
of robins in the trundle bed
how many i espy
whose nightgowns could not hide the wmgs
although i heard them try
but then i promised neer to tell
how could i break my word
so go your way  and ill go mine
no fear youll miss the road
it is dead  find it
out of sound  out of slght
happy which is wiser
you or the wind
conscious       on t you askth at
of the low ground
homesick many met it
even through them this
cannot testify
themself  as dumb
not in this world to see his face
sounds long  until i read the place
where this  is said to be
but just the primer  to a life
unopenedrare upon the shelf
clasped yet  to him  and me
and yet  my primer suits me so
i would not choose  a book to know
than that be sweeter wise
might some one else  so learned  be
and leave mejust my abc
himself  could have the skies
we grow accustomed to the dark
when light is put away
as when the neighbor holds the lamp
to witness her goodbye
a moment we uncertain step
for newness of the night
thenfit our vision to the dark
and meet the road  erect
and so of larger  darknesses
those evenings of the bram
when not a moon disclose a sign
or starcome outwithin
the bravest  grope a little
and sometimes hit a tree
directly m the forehead
but as they learn to see
either the darkness alters
or something in the sight
adjusts itself to midnight
and life steps almost straight
youll know itas you know tis noon
by glory
as you do the sun
by glory
as you will in heaven
know god the father  and the son
by intuition mightiest things
assert themselvesand not by terms
im midnight need the midnight say
im sunrise  need the majesty
omnipotence  had not a tongue
his iispis lightnmgand the sun
his conversation  with the sea
how shall you know
consult your eye
a charm invests a face
imperfectly beheld
the lady dare not lift her veil
for fear it be dispelled
but peers beyond her mesh
and wishes  and denies
lest interview  annul a want
that image  satisfies
more lifewent outwhen he went
than ordinary breath
lit with a finer phosphor
requiring in the quench
a power of renowned cold
the climate of the grave
a temperature just adequate
so anthracite to live
for some  an ampler zero
a frost more needle keen
is necessary to reduce
the ethiop within
others  extinguish easier
a gnats mmutest fan
sufficlent to obliterate
a tract of cltizen
whose peat lift  amply vivid
ignores the solemn news
that popocatapel exists
or etnas scarlets choose
the months have ends  the years  a knot
no power can untle
to stretch a little further
a skein of misery
the earth lays back these tlred lives
in her mysterious drawers
too tenderly that any doubt
an ultimate repose
the manner of the chlldren
who weary of the day
themselfthe noisy plaything
they cannot put away

removed from accident of loss
by accident of gain
befalling not my simple days
myself had just to earn
of riches  as unconscious
as is the brown malay
of pearls in eastern waters
marked his  what holiday
would stir his slow conception
had he the power to dream
that but the dowers fraction

i run it over  dead brain dead
put it in latin left of my school
seems it dont shriek so  under rule
tum it a little  full in the face
a trouble looks bitterest
shift it  just
say when tomorrow comes this way
i shall have waded down one day
i suppose it will mterrupt me some
till i get accustomed but then the tomb
like other new things  shows largest  then
and smaller by habit
its shrewder then
put the thought m advance  a year

and doubt that you are mine
to have the joy of feeling it  again
ill show you at the court
bear you  for ornament
where women breathe
that every sigh  may lift you
just as high  as l
and  when i die
in meek array  display you
still to show  how rich i go
lest skies impeach a wealth so wonderful
and banish me
takmg up the fair ideal
just to cast her down
when a fracture  we discover
or a splintered crown
makes the heavens portable
and the gods  a he
doubtless  adam  scowled at eden
for hls perjury
cherishing  our poor ideal
till in purer dress
we behold her  glonfied
comforts  search like this
till the broken creatures
we adored  for whole
stains  all washed
transfigured  mended
meet uswith a smile
the moon is distant from the sea
and yet with amber hands
she leads him  docile as a boy
along appointed sands
he never misses a degree
obedient to her eye
he comes just so fartoward the town
just so fargoes away
oh signor thine the amber hand
and mine  the distant sea
obedient to the least command
thine eye impose on me
it would never be common  more  i said
difference  had begun
many a bitterness  had been
but that old sort  was done
or if it sometime  showed  as twlll
upon the downiestmorn
such bliss  had i  for all the years
twould give an easierpain
id so much joy  i told it  red
upon my simple cheek
i felt it publish  m my eye
twas needless  any speak
i walked  as wings  my body bore
the feet  i former used
unnecessary  now to me
as boots  would be  to birds
i put my pleasure all abroad
i dealt a word of gold
to every creature  that i met
and dowered  all the world
when  suddenly  my riches shrank
a goblm  drank my dew
my palacesdropped tenantless
myself  was beggared  too
i clutched at sounds
i groped at shapes
i touched the tops of films
i felt the wilderness roll back
along my golden lines
the sackcloth  hangs upon the nail
the frock i used to wear
but where my moment of brocade
mydropof india
mecome my dazzled face
in such a shining place
mehear my foreign ear
the sounds of welcome  there
the saints forget
our bashful feet
my holiday shall be
that theyremember me
my paradise  the fame
that they  pronounce my name
do people moulder equally
they bury in the grave
i do believe a species
as posltlvely live
as i who testify it
deny that i  am dead
and fill my lungs for witness
from tanks  above my head
i say to you said jesus
that there be standing here
a sort that shall not taste of death
if jesus was sincere
i need no further argue
that statement of the lord
is not a controvertible
he told me death was dead
knows how to forget
but could it teach it
easiest of arts they say
when one learn how
dull hearts have died
in the acquisitlon
sacrifice for science
is common though now
i went to school
but was not wiser
globe did not teach it
nor logarithm show
h ow to f orgeti
say  some  philosopher
ah to be erudite
enough to know
is it in a book

to offer whom a chair
were as impossible as hand

no bone had he to bind him
his speech was like the push

from a superior bush

god made a little gentian
it tried  to be a rose
and failedand all the summer laughed
but just before the snows
there rose a purple creature
that ravished all the hili

and mockery  was still
the frosts were her condition

creator  shall i  bloom
i tie my hati crease my shawl

as the very least
were infinite  to me
i put new blossoms in the glass
and throw the old  away
i push a petal from my gown

i have so much to do
and yet  existence  some way back
stopped  struck  my ticking  through
we cannot put ourself away
as a completed man
or woman  when the errands done
we carne to flesh  upon
there may be  miles on miles of nought
of action  sicker far
to simulate  is stinging work
to cover what we are
from science  and from surgery
too telescopic eyes
to hear on us unshaded
for their  sake  not for ours
twould start them
we  could tremble
but since we got a bomb
and held it in our bosom
nay hold it it is calm
thelefore  we do lifes labor
though lifes reward  be done
with scrupulous exactness
to hold our senses  on
it feels a shame to be ahve
when men so brave  are dead
one envies the dlstinguished dust
permitted  such a head
the stone  that tells defending whom
this spartan put away
what little of him we  possessed
in pawn for liberty
the price is great  sublimely paid
do we deserve a thing
that liveslike dollars must be piled
before we may obtain
are we that wait  sufficlent worth
that such enormous pearl
as lifedissolved be for us
in battleshorrid bowl
it may be  a renown to live
i think the man who die
those unsustained  saviors
present divinity
twas just this time last year i died
i know i heard the com
when i was carried by the farms
it had the tassels on
i thought how yellow it would look
when richard went to mill
and then i wanted to get out
but something held my will
i thought just how redapples wedged
the stubbles joints between
and the carts stoopmg round the fields
to take the pumpkms in
i wondered which would miss me least
and when thanksgivmg came
if fatherd multiply the plates
to make an even sum
and would it blur the chnstmas glee
my stockmg hang too high
for any santa claus to reach
the altitude of me
but this sort grieved myself
and so i thought the other way
how just this time some perfect year
themself should come to me
i showed her heights she never saw
wouldst climb i said
she said not so
with me  i said  with me
i showed her secrets  mornings nest
the rope the nights were put across
and now  wouldst have me for a guest
she could not find her yes
and then i brake my life  and lo
a light for her did solemn glow
the larger as her face withdrew
and could she further no
could  i do more  for thee
wert thou a bumble bee
since for the queen have
nought but bouquet
this was a poet  it is that
distills amazing sense
from ordinary meanings
and attar so immense
from the familiar species
that perished by the door
we wonder it was not ourselves
arrested it  before
of pictures the discloser
the poet  it is he
entitles us by contrast
to ceaseless poverty
of portion  so unconscious
the robbing  could not harm
himself  to him  a fortune
exterior  to time
i died for beauty but was scarce
adjusted m the tomb
when one who died for tluth was lam
in an adjoming room
he questloned softly why i failed
for beauty i replied
and ifor truth themself are one
we brethren are he said
and so as kinsmen met a night
we talked between the rooms
un tll the moss had reached our lips
and covered up  our names
dreamsare well but wakings better
if one wake at mom

than a solid dawn  confronting

that regulates the wheel
though spokes  spin  more consplcuous

bliss  were an oddity  without thee
nicknamed by god
eternity
it was given to me by the gods
when i was a little girl
they give us presents most  you know
when we are new  and small
i kept it in my hand
i never put it down
i did not dare to eat  or sleep
for fear it would be gone
i heard such words as rich
when hurrying to school
from lips at corners of the streets
and wrestled with a smile
rich i twas myself  was rich
to take the name of gold
and gold to own  in solid bars
the difference  made me bold
triumph  may be of several kinds
theres triumph in the room
when that old imperatordeath
by faith be overcome
theres triumph of the finer mind
when truth  affronted long
advance unmoved  to her supreme
her god  her only throng
a triumph  when temptations bribe
be slowly handed back
one eye upon the heaven renounced
and oneupon the rack
severer triumph  by himself
experienced  who pass
acquitted  from that naked bar
jehovahs countenance
so well that i can live without
i love thee then how well is that
as well as jesus
prove it me
that he loved men
as i love thee
sweet  safe  houses
glad  gay  houses
sealed so stately tight
lids of steel on lids of marble
locking bare feet ou t
brooks of plush  in banks of satm
not so softly fall
as the laughter  and the whisper
from their people pearl
no bald death  affront their parlors
no bold sickness come
to deface their stately treasures
anguishand the tomb
hum bym mufhed coaches
lest they  wonder why
any  for the press of smiling
interrupt  to die
like eyes that looked on wastes
incredulous of ought
but blankand steady wilderness
diversified by night
just infimtes of nought
as far as it could see
so looked the face i looked upon
so looked itself  on me
i offered it no help
because the cause was mine
the misery a compact
as hopelessas divlne
neitherwould be absolved
neither would be a queen
without the other therefore
we perish  tho we reign
a tooth upon our peace
the peace cannot deface
then wherefore be the t oath
to vitalize the grace
the heaven hath a hell
itself to signalize
and every sign before the place
is gilt with sacrifice
i know where wells grow  droughtless wells
deep dug  for summer days
where mosses go no more away
and pebble  safely plays
its made of fathoms  and a belt
a belt of jagged stone
inlaid with emerald  half way down
and diamonds  jumbled on
it has no bucket were i rich
a bucket i would buy
im often thirsty  but my lips
are so high up you see
i read in an old fashioned book
that p eopie thiist no more
the wells have buckets to them there
it must mean that  im sure
shall we remember parchingthen
those waters sound so grand
i think a litde welllike mine
dearer to understand
a wife  at daybreak i shall be
sunrise  hast thou a flag for me
at midnight i am but a maid
how short it takes to make a bride
then  midmght i have passed from thee
unto the east and victory
midnight  good n ight l i hear them call
the angels bustle in the hall
softly my future climbs the stair
i fumble at my childhoods prayer
so soon to be a child no more
eternity im comingsir
savior  ive seen the face  before
why make it doubt it hurts it so
so sick  to guess
so strong  to know
so brave  upon its little bed
to tell the very last they said
unto itselfand smileand shake
for that deardistantdangerous sake
but  the instead  the pinching fear
that something  it did do  or dare
offend the visionand ithee
and they no more remember me
nor ever turn to tell me why
oh master this is misery
i live with himi see his face
i go no more away
for visitor  or sundown
deaths single privacy
the only oneforestallmg mme
and that  by right that he
presents a claim invisible
no wedlock  granted me
i live with him  i hear his volce
i stand alive  today
to witness to the certainty
of immortality
taught me  by time  the lower way
conviction  every day
that life like thisis stopless
be judgmentwhat it may
the power to be true to you
until upon my face
the judgment push his picture
presumptuous of your place
of this  could man deprive me
himself  the heaven excel
whose invitation  yours reduced
until it showed too small
i heard a fly buzz  when i died
the stillness in the room
was like the stillness in the air
between the heaves of storm
the eyes around  had wrung them dry
and breaths were gathering firm
for that last onset  when the kmg
be witnessedin the room
i willed my keepsakes  signed away
what portion of me be
assignable  and then it was
there interposed a fly
vlth blueuncertam stumblmg buzz
between the light  and me
and then the w mdows failed  and then
i could not see to see
tis little i  could care for pearls
who own the ample sea
or broocheswhen the emperor
with rubles  pelteth me
or gold  who am the prince of mmes
or diamonds  when have i
a diadem to fit a dome
continual upon me
we do not play on graves
because there isnt room
besides it isnt even  it slants
and people come
and put a flower on it
and hang their faces so
were fearing that their hearts will drop
and crush our pretty play
and so we move as far
as enemies away
just looking round to see how far
it is  occasionally
the manner of its death
when certain it must die
tis deemed a privilege to choose
twas major andres way
when choice of life is past
there yet remams a love
its little fate to stipulate
how small m those who bve
the miracle to tease
with babble of the styles
how they are dymg mostly  now
and customs at st james
the red  blaze  is the morning
the violet  is noon
the yellow  day  is fallmg
and after that  is none
but miles of sparksat evening
reveal the width that burned
the territory argent that
never yet  consumed
i am alive  i guess
the branches on my hand
are full of morning glory
and at my fingers end
the carmine  tmgles warm
and if i hold a glass
across my mouth  it blurs it
physicians  proof of breath
i am alive  because
i am not in a room
the parlor  commonly it is
so visitors may come
and lean  and view it sidewise
and add how cold  it grew
and was it consciouswhen it stepped
in immortality
i am alive  because
i do not own a house
entitled to myselfprecise
and fitting no one else
and marked my girlhoods name
so visitors may know
which door is mine  and not mistake
and try another key
how good  to be alive
how infinite  to be
alive  twofold  the birth i had
and this  besides in  thee
a night  there lay the days between
the day that was before
and day that was behind  were one
and now twas nightwas here
slow  night  that must be watched away
as grains upon a shore
too unperceptible to note
till it be night no more
i am ashamed  i hide
what right have i  to be a bride
so late a dowerless girl
nowhere to hide my dazzled face
no one to teach me that new grace
nor introducemy soul
me to adorn  how  tell
trinket  to make me beautlful
fabncs of cashmere
never a gown of dun  more
raiment instead  of pompadour
for memy soulto wear
fingers  to frame my round hair
oval as feudal ladles wore
far fashions  fair
skill to hold my brow like an earl
plead like a whippoorwill
prove like a pearl
then for character
except the heaven had come so near
so seemed to choose my door
the distance would not haunt me so
i had not hoped  before
but just to hear the grace depart
i never thought to see
afhicts me with a double ss
tis lostand lost to me
fashion my spirit quaint  white
quicklike a liquor
gaylike light
bring me my best pride
no more ashamed
no more to hide
meek let it be  too proud  fol pride
baptlzedthis daya bride
they put us far apart
as separate as sea
and her unsown pemnsula
we signified these see
they took away our eyes
they thwarted us with guns
i see thee each responded straight
through telegraphic slgns
with dungeons  they devised
but through their thickest skill
and their opaquest adamant
our souls saw just as well
they summoned us to die
with sweet alacrity
we stood upon our stapled feet
condemned  but just  to see
permission to recant
permission to forget
we turned our backs upon the sun
for perjury of that
not eithernoticed death
of paradise  aware
each others face  was all the disc
each others setting  saw
doom is the house without the door
tis entered from the sun
and then the ladders thrown away
because escape  is done
tis varied by the dream
of what they do outside
where squirrels play  and bemes die
and hemlocks  bow  to god
i meant to have but modest needs
such as content  and heaven
within my income  these could he
and life and i  keep even
but smce the last  mcluded both
it would suffice my prayer
but just for one  to stipulate
and grace would grant the pair
and so  upon this wise  i prayed
great spirit  give to me
a heaven not so large as yours
but large enough  for me
a smile suffused jehovahs face
the cherubim  withdrew
grave saints stole out to look at me
and showed their dimples  too
i left the place with all my might
i threw my prayer away
the quiet ages picked it up
and judgment  twinkled  too
that one so honest  be extant
it take the tale for true
that whatsoever ye shall ask
itself be given you
but i grown shrewder  scan the skies
with a suspiclous air
as children  swindled for the first
all swmdlers  be  infer
no man can compass a despair
as round a goalless road
no faster than a mile at once
the traveller proceed
unconsclous of the width
unconscious that the sun
be setting on his progress
so accurate the one
at estimating pain
whose own  has just begun
his ignorance  the angel
that pilot him along
i had no time to hate
because
the grave would hinder me
and life was not so
ample i
could finish  enmity
nor had i time to love
but since
some industry must be
the little toil of love
i thought
be large enough for me
she dealt her pretty words hke blades
how glittering they shone
and every one unbared a nerve
or wantoned with a bone
she never deemedshe hurt
thatis not steels affalr
a vulgar grimace in the flesh
how ill the creatures bear
to ache is human  not polite
the film upon the eye
mortalitys old custom
just locking up  to die
why do i love you sir
because
the wmd does not require the grass
to answer wherefore when he pass
she cannot keep her place
because he knows  and
do not you
and we know not
enough for us
the wisdom it be so
the lightning  never asked an eye
wherefore it shutwhen he was by
because he knows it cannot speak
and reasons not contained
of talk
there be  preferred by damtier folk
the sunnse  sir  compelleth me
because hes sunnseand i see
therefore  then
i love thee
the hlmmaleh was known to stoop
unto the daisy low
transported with compassion
that such a doll should grow
where tent by tenther universe
hung out its flags of snow
we cover thee sweet face
not that we tire of thee
but that thyself fatigue of us
remember  as thou go
we follow thee until
thou notice us  no more
and then  reluctant  tum away
to con thee oer and oer
and blame the scanty love
we were content to show
augmentedsweeta hundred fold
if thou wouldst take it  now
a solemn thing within the soul
to feel itself get ripe
and golden hang  while farther up
the makers ladders stop
and m the orchard far below
you hear a bemg  drop
a wonderful to feel the sun
still tollmg at the cheek
you thought was fimshed
cool of eye and crltical of work
he shifts the stem  a little
to give youl core  a look
but solemnest  to know
your chance in harvest moves
a little nearerevery sun
the single  to some lives
my garden like the beach
denotes there be  a sea
thats summer
such as these  the pearls
she fetches  such as me
to make ones toiletteafter death
has made the touette cool
of only taste we cared to please
is difficult and still
thats easierthan braid the hair
and make the bodice gay
when eyes that fondled it are wrenched
by decalogues  away
i was the slightest in the house
i took the smallest room
at night my little lamp and book
and one geranium
so stationed i could catch the mmt
that never ceased to fall
and just my basket
let me think  im sure
that this was all
i never spoke  unless addressed
and then twas brief and low
i could not bear to live  aloud
the racket shamed me so
and if it had not been so far
and anyone i knew
were goingi had often thought
how noteless  i could die
you love the lord  you cannot see
you write him  every day
a little note  when you awake
and further in the day
an ample letter  how you miss
and would delight to see
but then his house  is but a step
and minesin heaven you see
myself was formed  a carpenter
an unpretending time
my plane  and i together wrought
before a builder carne
to measure our attamrnents
had we the art of boards
sufficiently developed  hed hire us
at halves
my tools took hurnan faces
the bench where we had toiled
against the man  persuaded
wetemples buxldi sald
we pray  to heaven
we prate  of heaven
relatewhen neighbors die
at what oclock to heaven  they fled
who saw them  wherefore fly
is heaven a place  a sky  a tree
locations narrow way is for ourselves
unto the dead
theres no geography
but state  endowal focus
where  omnipresence  fly
to one denied to drink
to tell what water is
would be acuter would it not
than letting him surmise
to lead him to the well
and let him hear it drip
remmd him would it not somewhat
of his condemned lip
while it is alive
until death touches it
while it and i lap one air
dwell in one blood
under one sacrament
show me division can split or pare
love is like bfe  merely longer
love is like death during the grave
love is the fellow of the resurrection
scooping up the dust and chanting live
civilization  spurns  the leopard
was the leopard  bold
deserts  never rebuked her satin
ethiop  her gold
tawny  her customs
she was conscious
spotted  her dun gown
this was the leopards nature  signor
needa keeperfrown
pity  the pard  that left her asia
memories  of palm
cannot be stifled  with n arcotie
nor suppressed  with balm
the world  stands  solemner  to me
since i was wed  to him
a modesty befits the soul
that bears anothersname
a doubt  if it be fair  mdeed
to wear that perfect  pearl
the manupon the woman binds
to clasp her soul for all
a prayer that it more angel prove
a whiter gift  within
to that munificence that chose
so unadorned  a queen
a gratitude  that such be tiue
it had esteemed the dream
too beautiful for shape to prove
or posture  to redeem

and old sunshine  about

and two or three  for company
upon a hohday
crowded  as sacrament

a picture  if it care

for needmg more
flowers  to keep the eyes  from going awkward
when it snows
a bird  if they  prefer
though winter fire  sing clear as plover
to ourear
a landscape  not so great
to suffocate the eye
a hill perhaps
perhaps  the profile of a mill
t umed by the wind
tho such  are luxuries
its thoughts  and just two heart
and heaven  about
at least  a counterfeit
we would not have correct
and immortalitycan be almost
not quitecontent
as far from pity as complaint
as cool to speech  as stone
as numb to revelation
as if my trade were bone
as far from time  as hlstory
as near yourself  today
as children to the rainbows scarf
or sunsets yellow play
to eyelids iii the sepulchre
how dumb the dancer lies
vle colors revelations break
and blaze  the butterflies
he strained my faith
did he find it supple
shook my strong trust
did it then  yield
hurled my belief
but  did he shatter it
racked  with suspense
not a nerve failed
wrung me  with anguish
but i never doubted him
tho for what wrong
he did never say
stabbed  while i sued
his sweet forgiveness
jesus its your little john
dont you know  me
i envy seas whereon he rides
i envy spokes of wheels
of chariots that him convey
i envy crooked hills
that gaze upon his journey
how easy all can see
what is forbidden utterly
as heavenunto me
i envy nests of sparrows
that dot his distant eaves
the wealthy fly upon his pane
the happy  happy leaves
that just abroad his window
have summers leave to play
the ear rings of pizarro
could not obtain for me
i envy lightthat wakes him
and bells  that boldly nng
to tell him it is noon abroad
myself  be noon to him
yet interdict  my blossom
and abrogatemy bee
lest noon in everlasting night
drop gabriel and me
those fair  fictitious people
the women  plucked away
from our familiar lifetime
the men of ivory
those boys and girls in canvas
who stay upon the wall
in everlastmg keepsake
can anybody tell
we trust  in places perfecter
inheriting delight
beyond our famt conjecture
our dizzy estimate
remembering ourselves we trust
yet blesseder  than we
through knowing  where we only hope
receiving  where we  pray
of expectation  also
anticipating us
with transport that would be a pam
except for holmess
esteemmg us  as exile
themself  admitted home
through easy miracle of death
the way ourself must come
within my garden rides a bird
upon a single wheel
whose spokes a dizzy music make
astwere a travelling mill
he never stops but slackens
above the ripest rose
partakes without alighting
and praises as he goes
till every spice is tasted
and then his fairy gig
reels in remoter atmospheres
anq i rejoin my dog
and he and i perplex us
if positive twere we
or bore the garden in the brain
this curiosity
but he the best logician
refers my clumsy eye
to just vibrating blossoms
an exquisite reply
this world is not conclusion
a species stands beyond
invisible as music
but positive as sound
it beckons and it bafhes
philosophy  dont know
and through a riddle at the last
sagacity must go
to guess it puzzles scholars
to gain it men have borne
contempt of generations
and crucifixion shown
faith slips  and laughs and rallies
blushes if any see
plucks at a twig of evidence
and asks a vane the way
much gesture from the pulpit
strong hallelujahs roll
narcotics cannot still the tooth
that nibbles at the soul
at least  to pray  is left  is left
oh jesusin the air
i know not which thy chamber is
im knocking  everywhere
thou settest earthquake in the south
and maelstrom in the sea
say jesus chnst of nazareth
hast thou no arm for me
betterthan music for iwho heard it
i was used  to the birds  before
this  was different  twas t ranslatlon
of all tunes i knew  and more
twasnt contained like other stanza
no one could play it  the second time
but the composer  perfect mozart
perish with him  that keyless rhyme
so  children  told how brooks in eden
bubbled a better  melody
quaintly infer  eves great surrender
urging the feetthat wouldnotfly
children  matured  are wiser  mostly
eden  a legend  dimly told
eve  and the anguish  grandames story
but  i was tellmg a tune  i heard
not such a stram  the church  baptizes
ivhen the last saint  goes up the aisles
not such a stanza splits the silence
when the redemption strikes her bells
let me not spill its smallest cadence
humming  for promise  when alone
humminguntil my faint rehearsal
drop into tune  around the throne
c rz
you know that portrait in the moon
so tell me who tis like
the very brow  the stoopmg eyes
afog for  say  whose sake
the very pattern of the cheek
i t vanes  in the chm
but  ishmael since we met  tis long
and fashions  mtervene
when moons at full tis thou  i say
my lips just hold the name
when crescent  thou art worn  i note
but  there  the golden same
and when  some night  bold  slashmg clouds
cut thee away from me
thats easier  than the other film
that glazes holiday
i would not paint  a picture
id rather be the one
its bright impossibility
to dwell delicious  on
and wonder how the fingers feel
whose rare  celestial  stir
evokes so sweet a torment
such sumptuous  despair
i would not talk like cornets
id rather be the one
raised softly to the ceilings
and out and easy on
through villages of ether
myself endued balloon
by but a lip of metal
the pier to my pontoon
nor would i be a poet
its finer  own the ear
enamored impotent  content
the license to revere
a privilege so awful
what would the dower be
had i the art to stun myself
with bolts of melody
he touched me so i live to know
that such a day permitted so
i groped upon his breast
it was a boundless place to me
and silenced as the awful sea
puts minor streams to rest
and now im different from before
as if i breathed superior alr
or brushed a royal gown
my feet too that had wandered so
my gypsy face  transfigured now
to tenderer renown
into this port if i might come
rebecca to jerusalem
would not so ravished tum
nor persian bafhed at her shrine
lift such a crucifixal sign
to her imperial sun
she sights a bird  she chuckles
she flattens  then she crawls
she runs without the look of feet
her eyes increase to balls
her jaws stirtwitchinghungry
her teeth can hardly stand
she leaps but robm leaped the first
ah pussy of the sand
the hopes so juicy ripening
you almost bathed your tongue
when bliss disclosed a hundred toes
and fled with every one
im ceded  ive stopped being theirs
the name they dropped upon my face
with water in the country church
is finished usmg now
and they can put it with my dolls
my childhood and the strmg of spools
ive finished threading too
baptized before without the choice
but this time consciously of grace
unto supremest name
called to my full the crescent dropped
existences whole arc filled up
with one small diadem
my second rank  too small the first
crownedcrowingon my fathers breast
a half unconscious queen
but this time  adequate  erect
with will to choose or to reject
and i choose just a crown
if anybodys friend be dead
its sharpest of the theme
the thinlung how they walked alive
at such and such a time
their costume of a sunday
some manner of the hair
a prank nobody knew but them
lost in the sepulchre
how warm they were on such a day
you almost feel the date
so short way off it seems
and nowtheyre centuries from that
how pleased they were at what you said
you try to touch the smile
and dip your fingers in the frost
when was it  can you tell
you asked the company to tea
acquaintance  just a few
and chatted close with this grand thing
that dont remember you
past bows and invitations
past interview and vow
past what ourself can estimate
that  makes the quick of woe
it was not death for i stood up
and all the dead lie down
it was not night for all the bells
put out their tongues for noon
it was not frost for on my flesh
i felt siroccos  crawl
nor fire  for just my marble feet
could keep a chancel cool
and yet it tasted like them all
the figures i have seen
set orderly for bunal
reminded me of mine
as if my life were shaven
and fitted to a frame
and could not breathe without a key
and twas hke midnight some
when everythmg that ticked  has stopped
and space stares all around
or grisly frosts  first autumn moms
repeal the beating ground
but most hke chaosstoplesscool
without a chance or spar
or even a report of land
to justify  despair
if you were coming in the fall
d brush the summer by
with half a smile and half a spurn
as housewives do a fly
if i could see you in a year
id wmd the months in balls
and put them each in separate drawers
for fear the numbers fuse
if only centuries delayed
id count them on my hand
subtracting till my fingers dropped
into van diemans land
if certain when this life was out
that yours and mine should be
id toss it yonder hke a rind
and take eternity
but now uncertain of the length
of this that is between
it goads me like the goblm bee
that will not state  its sang
c l                                                 l
the soul has bandaged moments
when too appalled to stir
she feels some ghastly fright come up
and stop to look at her
salute her  with long fingers
caress her freezmg hair
slp goblin from the very lips
the lover  hovered   er
unworthy that a thought so mean
accost a theme  so  fair
the soul has moments of escape
when bursting all the doors
she dances like a bomb abroad
and swings upon the hours
as do the bee  delinous borne
long dungeoned from hls rose
touch liberty  then know no more
but noon and paradise
the souls retaken moments
when felon led along
with shackles on the plumed feet
and staples in the song
the horror welcomes her again
these are not brayed of tongue
like flowers that heard the news of dews
but never deemed the dripping prize
awaited theirlow brows
or beesthat thought the summers name
some rumor of delirium
no summer  could  for them
or arctic creatures dimly stirred
by tropic hint  some travelled bird
imported to the word
or wmds bright signal to the ear
making that homely and severe
contented known before
the heaven  unexpected come
to lives that thought the worshippmg
a too presumptuous psalm
her smile was shaped like other smiles
the dimples ran along
and still it hurt you as some bird
did hoist herself to sing
then recollect a ball she got
and hold upon the twig
convulsive while the music broke
like beads  among the bog
no crowd that has occurred
exhibiti suppose
that general attendance
that resurrection  does
circumference be full
the long restricted grave
assert her vital privilege
the dust  connect  and live
on atoms  features place
all multitudes that were
efface in the companson
as suns  dissolve a star
solemmty  prevail
its individual doom
possess each separate consciousness
augustabsorbednumb
what duphcate  exist
what parallel can be
of the sigmficance of this
to universeand me
beauty  be not caused  it is
chase it and it ceases
chase it not and it abides
overtake the creases
in the meadowwhen the wind
runs his fingers thro it
deity will see to it
that you never do it
he parts himselflike leaves
and then  he closes up
then stands upon the bonnet
of any buttercup
and then he runs against
and oversets a rose
and then does nothing
then away upon a jibhe goes
and dangles like a mote
suspended in the noon
uncertain  to return below
or settle in the moon
what come of himat night
the pnvilege to say
be hmited by ignorance
what come of him  that day
the frost  possess the world
in cabinets  be shown
a sepulchre of quaintest floss
an abbey  a cocoon
her sweet weight on my heart a night
had scarcely deigned to he
when stirnng for beliefs dehght
my bnde had slipped away
if twas a dream  made solid  just
the heaven to confirm
or if myself were dreamed of her
the power to presume
with him remain  who unto me
gave  even as to ali
a fiction superseding faith
by so much  as twas real
twas warm  at first like us
until there crept upon
a chilllike frost upon a glass
till all the scene be gone
the forehead copied stone
the fingers grew too cold
to acheand like a skaters brook
the busy eyes  congealed
it straightened that was all
it crowded cold to cold
it multiplied indifference
as pride were all it could
and even when with cords
twas lowered like a weight
it made no signal nor demurred
but dropped like adamant
i started early took my dog
and visited the sea
the mermaids in the basement
came out to look at me
and frigatesin the upper floor
extended hempen hands
presuming me to be a mouse
aground  upon the sands
but no man moved me  till the tide
went past my simple shoe
and past my apron  and my belt
and past my bodice  too
and made as he would eat me up
as wholly as a dew
upon a dandelions sleeve
and then  i started  too
and he  he followed  close behind
i felt his silver heel
upon my ankle then my shoes
would overflow with pearl
untll we met the solid town
no one he seemed to know
and bowing  with a mighty look
at me  the sea withdrew
endow the living  with the tears
you squander on the dead
and they were men and women  now
around your fireside
instead of passive creatures
denied the cherishing
till they  the cherishing deny
with deaths ethereal scorn
had i presumed to hope
the loss had been to me
a value  for the greatness sake
as giantsgone away
had i presumed to gain
a favor so remote
the failure but confirm the grace
in further infinite
tis failure  not of hope
but confident despair
advancing on celestial lists
with faint terrestrial power
tis honor  though i die
for that no man obtain
till he be justified by death
this  is the second gain
sweet  you forgot  but i remembered
every time  for two
so that the sum be never hindered
through decay of you
say if i erred accuse my farthmgs
blame the little hand
happy it be for youa beggars
seekmg more  to spend
just to be rich  to waste my guineas
on so best a heart
just to be poorfor barefoot vision
you  sweet  shut me out
departedto the judgment
a mighty afternoon
great clouds like ushers leaning
creation looking on
the flesh  surrendered  cancelled
the bodiless  begun
two worlds like audiences  disperse
and leave the soul alone
i think the hemlock likes to stand
upon a marge of snow
it suits his own austerity
and satisfies an awe
that men must slake in wilderness
and in the desert cloy
an instinct for the hoar the bald
laplands  neceity
the hemlocks nature thnveson cold
the gnash of northern winds
is sweetest nutrimentto hin
his best norwegian wines
to satin raceshe is nought
but children on the don
beneath his tabernacles play
and dmeper wrestlers run
to hear an onole sing
may be a common thing
or only a divine
it is not of the bird
who sings the same unheard
as unto crowd
the fashion of the ear
attireth that it hear
in dun or fair
so whether it be rune
or whether it be none
is ofwithm
the tune is in the tree
the skeptic  showeth me
no sir in thee
to put this world down like a bundle
and walk steady away
requires energy  possibly agony
tis the scarlet way
trodden with straight renunciation
by the son of god
later his famt confederates
justify the road
flavors of that old crucifuoon
filaments of bloom pontius pilate sowed
strong clusters from barabbas tomb
sacrament saints partook before us
patent every drop
with the brand of the gentile drinker
who indorsed the cup
c   i                                                 i
mine by the right of the white election
mine  by the royal seal i
mine  by the sign in the scarlet prison
bars  cannot conceal
mine  here  in vision  and in veto
mine  by the graves repeal
titled  confirmed
delirious charter
mine long as ages steal
im sorry for the dead  today
its such congenial times
old neighbors have at fences
its time d year for hay
and broad  sunburned acquaintance
discourse between the toil
and laugh a homely species
that makes the fences smile
it seems so straight to lie away
from all the noise of fields
the busy carts  the fragran t cocks
the mowers metre steals
a trouble lest theyre homesick
those farmers  and their wives
set separate from the farming
and all the neighbors lives
a wonder if the sepulchre
dont feel a lonesome way
when men  and boys  and carts  and june
go down the fields to hay
you cannot put a fire out
a thing that can ignite
can go itself without a fan
upon the slowest night
you cannot fold a flood
and put it in a drawer
because the winds would find it out
and tell your cedar floor
we dream  it is good we are dreaming
it would hurt us  were we awake
but since it is playing kill us
and we are playing  shriek
what harm men die  externally
it is a truthof blood
but we  are dying in drama
and drama  is never dead
cautious  we jar each other
and either  open the eyes
lest the phantasmprove the mlstake
and the livid surprise
cool us to shafts of gramte
with just an age  and name
and perhaps a phrase in egyptian
its prudenter to dream
i tned to think a lonelier thing
than any i had seen
some polar expiationan omen in the bone
of deaths tremendous nearness
i probed retrieveless things
my duplicateto borrow
a haggard comfort springs
from the belief that somewhere
within the clutch of thought
there dwells one other creature
of heavenly loveforgot
i plucked at our partition
as one should pry the walls
between himselfand horrors twin
within opposing cells
i almost strove to clasp his hand
such luxury it grew
that as myselfcould pity him
perhaps hepitied me
two butterflies went out at noon
and waltzed upon a farm
then stepped straight through the firmament
and rested on a beam
and then  together bore away
upon a shining sea
though never yet in any port
therr coming mentloned be
if spoken by the distant brrd
if met in ether sea
by frigate or by merchantman
no noticewasto me
we see  comparatively
the thing so towermg high
we could not grasp its segment
unaided yesterday
this mornings finer verdict
makes scarcely worth the toli
a furrow  our cordillera
our apennine  a knoll
perhaps tis kindlydone us
the anguish  and the loss
the wrenching  for his firmament
the thing belonged to us
to spare these striding spirits
some morning of chagrin
the waking in a gnatsembrace
our giants  further on
shes happy with a new content
that feels to herlike sacrament
shes busy  with an altered care
as just apprenticed to the air
shes tearful if she weep at all
for blissful causes most of all
that heaven pennit so meek as her
to such a fate  to minister
the heart asks pleasure  first
and then  excuse from pam
and then  those litde anodynes
that deaden suffering
and then  to go to sleep
and then  if it should be
the will of its inquisitor
the privilege to die
me prove it now  whoever doubt
me stop to prove it  now
make hastethe scruple death be scant
for opportunity
the rtver reaches to my feet
as yet  my heart be dry
oh loverlife could not convmce
might death  enable thee
the river reaches to my breast
still still my hands above
proclaim with their remaining might
dost recognize the love
the river reaches to my mouth
remember when the sea
swept by my searching eyes  the last
themselves were quick  wlth thee
tis true  they shut me in the cold
but then  themselves were warm
and could not know the feeling twas
forget it  lord  of them
let not my witness hinder them
in heavenly esteem
no paradise could beconferred
through their beloved blame
the hann they did  was short  and since
myselfwho bore itdo
forgive them  even as myself
or else  forgive not me
the province of the saved
should be the art  to save
through skill obtained in themselves
the science of the grave
no man can understand
but he that hath endured
the dissolutionm himself
that man  be qualified
to qualify despair
to those who failing new
mistake defeat for death  each time
till acclimated  to
i took my power in my hand
and went against the world
twas not so much as david had
but i  was twice bold
i aimed my pebble  but myself
was all the one that fell
was it goliah  was too large
or was myself  too small
some such butterfly be seen
on brazilian pampas
just at noon  no later  sweet
then  the license closes
some such spice  express and pass
subject to your pluckmg
as the stars you knew last night
foreigners  this morning
i had no cause to be awake
my bestwas gone to sleep
and morn a new politeness took
and failed to wake them up
but called the othersclear
and passed their curtains by
sweet morning  when i oversleep
knock  recollect  to me
i looked at sunriseonce
and then i looked at them
and wishfulness in me arose
for circumstance the same
twas such an ample peace
it could not hold a sigh
twas sabbathwith the bells divorced
twas sunset  all the day
so choosing but a gown
and taking but a prayer
the only raiment i should need
i struggled  and was there
i fear a man of frugal speech
i fear a silent man
haranguer  i can overtake
or babbler  entertain
but he who weigheth  while the rest
expend their furthest pound
of this mani am wary
i fear that he is grand
the martyr poetsdid not tell
but wrought their pang in syllable
that when their mortal name be numb
their mortal fate  encourage some
the martyr painters  never spoke
bequeathingratherto their work
that when therr conscious fingers cease
some seek in art  the art of peace
tis one by one  the father counts
and then a tract between
set cypherlessto teach the eye
the value of its ten
until the peevish student
acquire the quick of skill
then numerals are dowered back
adorning all the rule
tis mostly slate and pencil
and darkness on the school
distracts the childrens fingers
still the eternal rule
regards least cypherer alike
with leader of the band
and every separate urchins sum
is fashioned for his hand
tofill a gap
insert the thing that caused it
block it up
with other  and twill yawn the more
you cannot solder an abyss
with air
ive seen a dying eye
run round and round a room
in search of something  as it seemed
then cloudier become
and thenobscure with fog
and then  be soldered down
without disclosing what it be
twere blessed to have seen
death is potential to that man
who dies  and to his friend
beyond that  unconspicuous
to anyone but god
of these two  god remembers
the longest  for the friend
is integral and therefore
itself dissolved  of god
that i did always love
i bnng thee proof
that till i loved
i never lived  enough
that i shall love alway
i argue thee
that love is life
and life hath immortality
this  dost thou doubt  sweet
then have i
nothing to show
but calvary
i cross till i am weary
a mountam  in my mind
more mountainsthen a sea
more seas  and then
a desert  find
and my horizon blocks
with steadydriftinggrains
of unconjectured quantlty
as asiatic rains
nor thisdefeat my pace
it hinder from the west
but as an enemys salute
one hurrymg to rest
what ment had the goal
except there intervene
famt doubt  and far competitor
to jeopardize the gain
at last  the grace  sight
i shout unto my feet
i offer them the whole of heaven
the instant that we meet
they stnve  and yet delay
they perish  do we die
or is this deaths expenment
reversed   victory
there is a shame of nobleness
confrontog sudden pelf
a finer shame of ecstasy
convicted of itself
a best disgrace  a brave man feels
acknowledged  of the brave
one more  ye blessed  to be told
but thats  behind the grave
an ignorance a sunset
confer upon the eye
of territory  color
circumference decay
its amber revelation
exhilarate  debase
omnipotence inspection
of our infenor face
and when the solemn features
confirm  in victory
we start  as if detected
in immortality
one crucifixion is recorded  only
how many be
is not affirmed of mathematics
or hlstory
one calvaryexhibited to stranger
as many be
as persons  or peninsulas
gethsemane
is but a provincein the beings centre
judea
for journey  or crusades achieving
too near
our lordindeedmade compound wltness
and yet
theres newer  nearer crucifixion
than that
the black berry  wears a thorn in his side
but no man heard him cry
he offers his berry just the same
to partridge  and to boy
he sometimes holds upon the fence
or struggles to a tree
or clasps a rock with both his hands
but not for sympathy
wetell a hurtto cool it
this mourner  to the sky
a little further reaches  instead
brave black berry
trustm the unexpected
by this  was william kidd
persuaded of the buried gold
as one had testlfied
through this  the old philosopher
his talismanic stone
discerned  still withholden
to effort unruvine
twas this  allured columbus
when genoa  wlthdrew
before an apparition
baptized america
the same  afhicted thomas
when deity assured
twas better  the perceivmg not
provided it believed
the brain within lts groove
runs evenly  and true
but let a splinter swerve
twere easier for you
to put a current back
when floods have slit the hills
and scooped a turnpike for themselves
and trodden out the mills
she hideth her the last
and is the first to rise
her night doth hardly recompense
the closing of her eyes
she doth her purple work
and putteth her away
in low apartments in the sod
as worthily as we
to imitate her life
as impotent would be
as make of our imperfect mints
the julep  of the bee
but little carmine hath her face
of emerald scant  her gown
her beauty is the love she doth
itself  exhibit  mine
it knew no medicine
it was not sickness  then
nor any need of surgery
and therefore  twas not pain
it moved away the cheeks
a dimple at a time
and left the profile  plainer
and in the place of bloom
it left the little tint
that never had a name
youve seen it on a casts face
was paradise  to blame
if momently ajar
temerity  drew near
and sickened  ever afterward
for somewhat that it saw
it knew no lapse nor diminution
but large  serene
burned on  until through dissolution
it failed from men
i could not deem these planetary forces
annulled
but suffered an exchange of t erntory
or world
i measure every grief i meet
with narrow probing eyes
i wonder if it weighs like mine
or has an easier size
i wonder if they bore it long
or did it just begin
i could not tell the date of mine
it feels so old a pain
i wonder if it hurts to live
and if they have to try
and whether  could they choose between
it would not be  to die
i note that some  gone patient long
at length renew their smile
an imitation of a light
that has so little oil
i wonder if when years have piled
some thousands  on the harm
that hurt them earlysuch a lapse
could give them any balm
or would they go on aching still
through centuries of nerve
enlightened to a larger pain
in contrast with the love
the grieved  are many  i am told
there is the various cause
death is but one  and comes but once
and only nails the eyes
theres grief of want  and grief of cold
a sort they call despair
theres banishment from native eyes
in sight of native air
and though i may not guess the kmd
correctly  yet to me
a piercmg comfort it affords
in passmg calvary
to note the fashions  of the cross
and how theyre mostly worn
still fascinated to presume
that someare like myown
conjecturing a climate
of unsuspended suns
adds poignancy to winter
the shivering fancy turns
to a fictitious country
to palliate a cold
not obviated of degree
nor eased  of latitude
i could not prove the years had feet
yet confident they run
am i from symptoms that are past
and series that are done
i find my feet have further goals
i smile upon the aims
that felt so ample  yesterday
todayshave vaster claims
i do not doubt the self i was
was competent to me
but something awkward in the fit
proves that  outgrown  i see
my period had come for prayer
no other art  would do
my tactics missed a rudiment
creator was it you
god grows above  so those who pray
horizons must ascend
and so i stepped upon the north
to see this curious friend
his house was not  no sign had he
by chimney nor by door
could i infer his residence
vast prairies of air
unbroken by a settler
were all that i could see
infinitudehadstthou no face
that i might look on thee
the silence condescended
creation stopped  for me
but awed beyond my errand
i worshipped  did not pray
one anguish  in a crowd
a mmor thing  it sounds
and yet unto the single doe
attempted of the hounds
tis terror as consummate
as legions of alarm
did leap full banked upon the host
tis umtsmake the swarm
a small leech  on the vitals
the sliver in the lung
the bung out  of an artery
are scarce accounted  harms
yet mighty by relation
to that repealless thing
a beingimpotent to end
when once it has begun
a dying tiger  moaned for drink
i hunted all the sand
i caught the dripping of a rock
and bore it in my hand
his mighty balls  in death were thick
but searching  i could see
a vision on the retma
of water  and of me
twas not my blame  who sped too slow
twas not his blame  who died
while i was reachmg him
but twas  the fact that he was dead
he gave away his life
to usgigantic sum
a tnbe  in his own esteem
but magnified  by fame
until it burst the hearts
that fancied they could hold
when swift it slipped its limit
and on the heavens  unrolled
tis ours  to wince  and weep
and wonder  and decay
by blossoms gradual process
he chose  maturity
and quickening  as we sowed
just obviated bud
and when we turned to note the growth
broke  perfect  from the pod
we learned the whole of love
the alphabet the words
a chapterthen the mighty book
then  revelation closed
but in each others eyes
an ignorance beheld
diviner than the childhoods
and each to each a child
attempted to expound
what neither  understood
alas that wisdom is so large
and truth  so manifold
i reckon  when i count at all
first  poets  then the sun
then summer  then the heaven of god
and then  the list is done
but looking back  the first so seems
to comprehend the whole
the others look a needless show
so i write  poets  all
their summer lasts a solid year
they can afford a sun
the east  would deem extravagant
and if the further heaven
be beautiful as they prepare
for those who worship them
it is too difficult a grace
to justify the dream
i could die  to know
tis a trifling knowledge
newsboys salute the door
carts  joggle by
mornings bold face  stares in the window
were but mine  the charter of the least fly
houses hunch the house
with their brick shoulders
coals  from a rolling load  rattle  how  near
to the very square  his foot is passing
possibly this moment
while i  dream  here
must be a woe
a loss or
to bend the eye
best beautys way
but  once aslant
it notes delight
as difficult
as stalactite
a common bliss
were had for less
the price  is
even as the grace
our lord  thought no
extravagance
to paya cross
delight becomes pictorial
when viewed through pain
more fair  because impossible
that any gain
the mountainat a given distance
in amber lies
approached  the amber hits  a little
and thatsthe skies
the test of love  is death
our lord  so loved  it saith
what largest lover  hath
another  doth
if smaller patience  be
through less infinity
if bravo sometimes swerve
through fainter nerve
accept its most
and overlook  the dust
last  least
the cross  request
my first well day  since many ill
i asked to go abroad
and take the sunshine in my hands
and see the things in pod
ablossom just when i went in
to take my chance with pain
uncertain if myself or he
should prove the strongest one
the summer deepened while we strove
she put some flowers away
and redder cheeked ones  in their stead
a fondillusive way
to cheat herself it seemed she tried
as if before a child
to fade  tomorrow  rainbows held
the sepulchre could hide
she dealt a fashion to the nut
she tied the hoods to seeds
she dropped bright scraps of t mt about
and left brazilian threads
on every shoulder that she met
then both her hands of haze
put up  to hide her parting grace
from our unfitted eyes
my loss by sickness  was it loss
or that ethereal gam
one earns by measuring the grave
then  measuring the sun
heaven has different signs  to me
sometimes i think that noon
is but a symbol of the place
and when again at dawn
a mighty look runs round the world
and settles in the hills
an awe if it should be like that
upon the ignorance steals
the orchard when the sun is on
the triumph of the birds
when they together victory make
some carnivals of clouds
the rapture of a finished day
returning to the west
all these  remind us of the place
that men cali paradise
itself he fairer  we suppose
but how ourself shall be
adorned for a superior grace
not yet our eyes can see
i prayed at first a little girl
because they told me to
but stopped when qualified to guess
how prayer would feel to me
if i believed god looked around
each time my childish eye
fixed full and steady on his own
in childish honesty
and told him whatid like today
and parts of his far plan
that bafhed me
the mingled side
of his divinity
and often since in danger
i count the force twould be
to have a god so strong as that
to hold my life for me
till i could take the balance
that tips so frequent now
it takes me all the while to poise
and then  it doesnt stay
if i may have it when its dead
ill be contented  so
if just as soon as breath is out
it shall belong tome
until they lock it in the grave
tis bliss i cannot weigh
for tho they lock thee in the grave
myselfcan own the key
think of it lover i and thee
permitted  face to face to be
mter a life  a death  well say
for death was that
and this  is thee
ill tell thee all how bald it grew
how midmght felt at first  to me
how all the clocks stopped in the world
and sunshine pinched me  twas so cold
then how the grief got sleepy  some
as if my soul were deaf and dumb
just making signs  across  to thee
that this waythou couldst notice me
ill tell you how i tried to keep
a smile to show you when this deep
all waded we look back for play
at those old timesin calvary
forgive me if the grave corne slow
for coveting to look at thee
forgive me if to stroke thy frost
outvisions paradise
the body grows without
the more convenient way
that if the spirit like to hide
its temple stands alway
ajar secure  inviting
it never did betray
the soul that asked its shelter
in solemn honesty
i had been hungry all the years
my noon had cometo dme
i trembling drew the table near
and touched the curious wme
twas this on tables i had seen
when turmng hungry home
i looked in windows for the wealth
i could not hope for mme
i did not know the ample bread
twas so unlike the crumb
the birds and i had often shared
in naturesdmmg room
the plenty hurt me  twas so new
myself felt  and odd
as berry  of a mountam bush
transplanted  to the road
nor was i hungry  so i found
that hungerwas a way
of persons outside windows
the entering  takes away
i gave myself to him
and took himself for pay
the solemn contract of a life
was ratified this way
the wealth might disappoint
myself a poorer prove
than this great purchaser suspect
the daily own  of love
depreciate the vision
but till the merchant buy
still fable  in the isles of spice
the subtle cargoes lie
at least tis mutual risk
somefound itmutual gam
sweet debt of life  each night to owe
insolventevery noon
i found the words to every thought
i ever had  but one
and that  defies me
as a hand did try to chalk the sun
to races  nurtured in the dark
how would your own  begin
can blaze be shown in cochmeal
or noonin mazarin
inconceivably solemn
things so gay
pierce  by the very press
of imagery
their far parades  order on the eye
with a mute pomp
a pleadmg pageantry
flags are a brave sight
but no true eye
ever went by one
steadily
musics triumphant
but the fine ear
winces with delight
are drums too near
a toad can die of light
death is the common right
of toads and men
of earl and midge
the privilege
why swagger then
the gnats supremacy is large as thme
life  is a different thing
so measure wine
naked of flask  naked of cask
bare rhine
which rubys mine
it ceased to hurt me though so slow
i could not feel the anguish go
but only knew by looking back
that something  had benumbed the track
nor when it altered i could say
for i had worn it every day
as constant as the childish frock
i hung upon the peg at night
but not the gnef  that nestled close
as needles ladies softly press
to cushions cheeks
to keep their place
nor what consoled it i could trace
except whereas twas wilderness
its betteralmost peace
i like to see it lap the miles
and lick the valleys up
and stop to feed itself at tanks
and then  prodigious step
around a pile of mountains
and supercilious peer
in shanties  by the sides of roads
and then a quarry pare
to t its ribs
and crawl between
complaining all the while
in horrid  hooting stanza
then chase itself down hill
and neigh like boanerges
thenpunctual as a star
stopdocile and omnipotent
at its own stable door
we talked as girls do
fond and late
we speculated fair on every subject but the grave
of ours none affair
we handled destinies as cool
as we  disposers  be
and god a quiet party
to our authority
but fondest dwelt upon ourself
as we eventual be
when girls to women softly raised
we occupy degree
we parted with a contract
to cherish and to write
but heaven made both impossible
before another night
empty my heart of thee
its single artery
begin and leave thee out
simply extinctions date
much billow hath the sea
one baltic  they
subtract thyself in play
and not enough of me
is left  to put away
myself meant thee
erase the root  no tree
thee  then  no me
the heavens stripped
eternitys vast pocket picked
i cried at pity  not at pain
i heard a woman say
poor child  and something in her voice
convicted me  of me
so long i fainted to myself
it seemed the common way
and health and laughter curious things
to look at like a toy
to sometimes hear rich people buy
and see the parcel rolled
and carried i supposed  to heaven
for children made of gold
but not to touch or wish for
or think of with a sigh
and so and so  had been to me
had god willed differently
i wish i knew that womans name
so when she comes this way
to hold my me and hold my ears
for fear i hear her say
shes sorry i am dd
ea  agam
just when the grave and
have sobbed ourselves almost to sleep
our only lullaby
the night was wide and furnished scant
with but a single star
that often as a cloud it met
blew out itself  for fear
the wind pursued the little bush
and drove away the leaves
november leftthen clambered up
and fretted in the eaves
no squirrel went abroad
a dogs belated feet
like intermittent plush he heard
adown the empty street
to feel if blinds be fast
and closer to the fire
her little rocking chair to draw
and shiver for the poor
the housewifes gentle task
how pleasanter  said she
unto the sofa opposite
the sleet  than may no thee
did you ever stand in a caverns mouth
widths out of the sun
and lookand shudder and block your breath
and deem to be alone
in such a place what horror
how goblin it would be
and fly as twere pursuing you l
then loneliness looks so
did you ever look in a cannons face
between whose yellow eye
and yours  the judgment intervened
the question of to die
extemporizing in your ear
as cool as satyrs drums
if you remember and were saved
its liker so  it seems
c   z                                                    z
to interrupt his yellow plan
the sun does not allow
caprices of the atmosphere
and even when the snow
heaves balls of specks like vicious boy
directly in his eye
does not so much as tum his head
busy with majesty
tis his to stimulate the earth
and magnetize the sea
and bind astronomy in place
yet any passing by
would deem ourselves  the busier
as the minutest bee
that rides  emits a thunder
a bomb  to justify
what care the dead for chanticleer
what care the dead for day
tis late your sunrise vex their face
and purple ribaldry  of morning
pour as blank on them
as on the tier of wall
the mason builded yesterday
and equally as cool
what care the dead for summer
the solstice had no sun
could waste the snow before their gate
and knew one bird a tune
could thrill their mortised ear
of all the birds that be
this one  beloved of mankind
henceforward cherished be
what care the dead for wmter
themselves as easy freeze
june noon  as january night
as soon the south  her breeze
of sycamore  or cinnamon
deposit in a stone
and put a stone to keep it warm
give spices  unto men
i think i was enchanted
hen first a sombre girl
i read that foreign lady
the darkfelt beautiful
and whether it was noon at night
or only heavenat noon
for very lunacy of light
i had not power to tell
the bees became as butterflies
the butterflies  as swans
approached  and spurned the narrow grass
and just the meanest tunes
that nature murmured to herself
to keep herself in cheer
i took for giants  practising
titanic opera
the days  to mighty metres stept
the homeliest  adorned
as if unto a jubilee
twere suddenly confirmed
i could not have defined the change
conversion of the mind
like sanctifying in the soul
is witnessed  not explained
twas a divine insanity
the danger to be sane
should i again experience
tis antidote to tum
to tornes of solid witchcraft
magicians be asleep
but magic  hath an element
like deity  to keep
the battle fought between the soul
and no man  is the one
of all the battles prevalent
by far the greater one
no news of it is had abroad
its bodiless campaign
establishes and terminates
invisible  unknown
nor historyrecord it
as legions of a night
the sunrise scatters  these endure
enactand terminate
like mighty foot lights  burned the red
at bases of the trees
the far theatricals of day
exhibiting  to these
twas umversethat did applaud
whilechiefestof the crowd
enabled by his royal dress
myself distinguished god
when i was small a woman died
today her only boy
went up from the potomac
his face all victory
to look at her  how slowly
the seasons must have turned
till bullets clipt an angle
and he passed quickly round
if pride shall be in paradise
ourself cannot decide
of their imperial conduct
no person testified
but proud m apparition
that woman and her boy
pass back and forth before my bram
as even in the sky
im confident that bravoes
perpetual break abroad
for braveries remote as this
in scarlet maryland
it always felt to me  a wrong
to that old moses  done
to let him see  the canaan
without the entermg
and tho in soberer moments
no moses there can be
im satisfied  the romance
in point of injury
surpasses sharper stated
of stephen  or of paul
for these  were only put to death
while gods adroiter wlll
on moses  seemed to fasten
with tantalizing play
as boy  should deal with lesser boy
to prove ability
the faultwas doubtless israels
myselfhad banned the tribes
and ushered grand old moses
in pentateuchal robes
upon the broad possession
twas irttle  but titled him  to see
old man on nebo l late as this
my justice bleeds  for thee
three times  we parted  breath  and i
three times  he would not go
but strove to stir the lifeless fan
the waters  strove to stay
three times  the billows tossed me up
then caught me  hke a bail
then made blue faces in my face
and pushed away a sail
that crawled leagues offi liked to see
for thinking  while i die
how pleasant to behold a thing
where human faces  be
the waves grew sleepy  breath  did not
the wmdslike childrenlulled
then sunrise kissed my chrysalis
and i stood up  and lived
there is a pam  so utter
it swallows substance up
then covers the abyss with trance
so memory can step
aroundacrossupon it
as one within a swoon
goes safely  where an open eye
would drop him  bone by bone
it troubled me as once i was
for i was once a child
concludmg how an atom  fell
and yet the heavens  held
the heavens weighed the most by far
yet blue  and solid  stood
without a bolt  that i could prove
would giants  understand
life set me largerproblems
some i shall keep  to solve
till algebra is easier
or simpler proved  above
then  too  be comprehended
what sorerpuzzled me
why heaven did not break away
and tumbleblueonme
a still volcano  life
that flickered in the night
when it was dark enough to do
without erasing sight
a quietearthquake style
too subtle to suspect
by natures this side naples
the north cannot detect
the solemn torridsymbol
the lips that never lie
whose hissing corals part  and shut
and citiesooze away
of brussels  it was not
of kidderminster nay
the wmds did buy it of the woods
they  sold it unto me
it was a gentle price
the poorest  could afford
it was within the frugal purse
of beggar  or of bird
of small and spicy yards
in hue  a mellow dun
of sunshine  and of sere  composed
but principally  of sun
the w md  unrolled it fast
and spread it on the ground
upholsterer of the pmes  is he
upholsterer  of the pond
he found my being  set it up
adjusted it to place
then carved his name  upon it
and bade it to the east
be faithfulin his absence
and he would come again
with equipage of amber
that time  to take it home
unto my books  so good to tum
far ends of tired days
it half endears the abstinence
and pain  is missed  in praise
as flavors  cheer retarded guests
with banquettings to be
so spices  stimulate the time
till my small library
it may be wilderness  without
far feet of failing men
but holidayexcludes the mght
and it is bells  within
i thank these kmsmen of the shelf
their countenances kid
enamor  in prospective
and satisfy  obtamed
the spider holds a silver ball
in unperceived hands
and dancing softly to himself
his yarn of pearl unwinds
he plies from nought to nought
in unsubstantial trade
supplants our tapestries with his
in half the period
an hour to rear supreme
his continents of light
then dangle from the housewifes broom
his boundaries  forgot

there seemed to rise a tune
from miniature creatures
accompanying the sun
far psalteries of summer
enamoring the ear
they never yet did satisfy
remotestwhen most fair
the sun shone whole at intervals
then halfthen utter hid
as if himself were optional
and had estates of cloud
sufficient to enfold him
eternally from view
except it were a whim of his
to let the orchards grow
a bird sat careless on the fence
one gossipped in the lane
on silver matters charmed a snake
just wlnding round a stone
bnght flowers slit a calyx
and soared upon a stem
like hindered flags  sweet hoisted
with spices  in the hem

of nearness to her sundered things
the soul has special times
when dimness looks the oddity
distinctness  easy  seems
the shapes we buried dwell about
familiar in the rooms
untarnished by the sepulchre
the mouldering playmate comes
in just the jacket that he wore
long buttoned in the mold
since we  old mornings children  played
divided  by a world
the grave yields back her robberies
the years our pilfered things
bright knots of apparitions
salute us with their wmgs
as we  it were  that perished
themself  had just remamed till we rejoin them
and twas they and not ourself
that mourned
afraid of whom am i afraid
not deathfor who is he
the porter of my fathers lodge
as much abasheth me
of life twere odd i fear a thing
that comprehendeth me
in one or two existences
as deity decree
of resurrection is the east
afraid to trust the mom
with her fastidious forehead
as soon impeach my crown
i years had been from home
and now before the door
i dared not enter lest a face
i never saw before
stare stolid into mine
and ask my business there
my business but a life i left
was such remaining there
i leaned upon the awe
i lmgered with before
the second like an ocean rolled
and broke against my ear
i laughed a crumbling laugh
that i could fear a door
who consternation compassed
and never winced before
i fitted to the latch
my hand with trembling care
lest back the awful door should spring
and leave me in the floor
then moved my fingers off
as cautiously as glass
and held my ears and like a thief
fled gasping from the house
youll findit when you try to die
the easier to let go
for recollecting such as went
you could not spare  you know
and though their places somewhat filled
as did their marble names
with moss  they never grew so full
you chose the newer names
and when this worldsets further back
as dying  say it does
the fonner love  distincter grows
and supersedes the fresh
and thought of them  so fair invites
it looks too tawdry grace
to stay behmd  with just the toys
we bought  to ease their place
i see thee better  m the dark
i do not need a light
the love of thee  a prism be
excelling violet
i see thee better for the years
that hunch themselves between
the miners lampsufficient be
to nullify the mme
and in the gravei see thee best
its little panels be
aglow  all ruddy  with the light
i held so high for thee
what need of day
to those whose dark  hath so  surpassing sun
it deem it becontinually
at the meridian
it would have starved a gnat
to live so small as l
and yet i was a living child
with foods necessity
upon melike a claw
i could no more remove
than i could coax a leech away
or make a dragon  move
nor like the gnathad
the privilege to fly
and seek a dinner for myself
how mightier he than
nor like himself  the art
upon the window pane
to gad my little being out
and not begin  again
they shut me up in prose
as when a little girl
they put me in the closet
because they liked me still
still could themself have peeped
and seen my bram  go round
they might as wise have lodged a bird
for treason  in the pound
himself has but to will
and easy as a star
abolish his captivity
and laugh  no more have
in falling timbers buried
there breathed a man
outside  the spades  were plying
the lungswithin
could he know they sought him
could they  know he breathed
horrid sand partition
neithercould be heard
never slacked the diggers
but when spades had done
oh reward of anguish
it was dying then
many thmgs  are fruitless
tis a bafhmg earth
but there is no gratitude
like the grace  of death
our journey had advanced
our feet were almost come
to that odd fork in beings road
eternity  by term
our pace took sudden awe
our feetreluctantled
before  were cities  but between
the forest of the dead
retreat  was out of hope
behind  a sealed route
eternitys white flagbefore
and god  at every gate
i rose  because he sank
i thought it would be opposite
but when his power dropped
my soul grew straight
i cheered my fainting prince
i sang firm  even  chants
i helped his filmwith hymn
and when the dews drew off
that held his forehead stiff
i met him
balm to balm
i told him best  must pass
through this low arch of flesh
no casque so brave
it spurn the grave
l told him worlds i knew
where emperors grew
who recollected us
if we were true
and so with thews of hymn
and smew from within
and ways i knew not that i knew  till then
i lifted him
dont put up my thread and needle
ill begin to sew
when the birds begin to whistle
better stitchesso
these were bent  my sight got crooked
when my mind is plain
ill do seamsa queens endeavor
would not blush to own
hems  too fine for ladys tracing
to the sightless knot
t ucks of dainty interspersion
like a dotted dot
leave my needle in the furrow
where i put it down
i can make the zigzag stitches
straight  when i am strong
till then  dreaming i am sewing
fetch the seam i missed
closer  so i  at my sleeping
still surmise i stitch
at leisure is the soul
that gets a staggering blow
the width of life  before it spreads
without a thing to do
it begs you give it work
but just the placing pins
or humblest patchworkchildren do
to help its vacant hands
glee  the great storm is over
four  have recovered the land
forty  gone down together
into the boiling sand
ring  for the scant salvation
t oll for the bonnie souls
neighbor  and friend  and bridegroom
spinnmg upon the shoals
how they will tell the story
when winter shake the door
till the children urge
but the forty
did theycome back no more
then a softness  suffuse the story
and a silence  the tellers eye
and the children  no further question
and only the seareply
it makes no difference abroad
the seasonsfitthe same
the mornings blossom mto noons
and split their pods of flame
wild bowers  kindle m the woods
the brooks slam  all the day
no black bird bates his banjo
for passing calvary
auto da feand judgment
are nothing to the bee
his separation from his rose
to him  sums misery
i asked no other thmg
no other  was denied
i offered bemgfor it
the mighty merchant sneered
brazil he twirled a button
without a glance my way
but  madam  is there nothing else
that we can show today
to know just how he suffered  would be dear
to know if any human eyes were near
to whom he could entrust his wavering gaze
until it settled broadon paradise
to know if he was patient  part content
was dying as he thought  or different
was it a pleasant day to die
and did the sunshine face his way
what was his furthest mindof home or god
or wha t the distant say
at news that he ceased human ature
such aday
and wishes  had he any
just his sighaccented
had been legible  to me
and was he confident until
iii fluttered outin everlasting weil
and if he spoke  what name was best
what last
what one broke off with
at the drowsiest
was he afraid  or tranquil
might he know
how conscious consciousness  could grow
till love that was  and love too best to be
meetand the junction be eternity
it was too late for man
but early yet for god
creation  impotent to help
but prayerremainedour side
how excellent the heaven
when earth  cannot be had
how hospitable  then  the face
of our old neighborgod
forever  is composed of n ows
tis not a different tirne
except for infiniteness
and latitude of home
from this  expenenced here
remove the dates  to these
let months dissolve in further mon ths
and years  exhale in years
without debate  or pause
or celebrated davs
no different our years would be
from anno dominis
twas a long partmg but the time
for interview  had come
before the judgment seat of god
the last  and second time
these fleshless lovers met
a heaven in a gaze
a heaven of heavens  the privilege
of one anothers eyes
no lifetimeon them
appareled as the new
unborn  except they had beheld
born infiniter  now
was bridaleer like this
a paradise  the host
and cherubim  and seraphim
the unobttusive guest
only god  detect the sorrow
only god
the jehovahsare no babblers
unto god
god the sonconfide it
still secure
god the spirits honor
just as sure
the tint i cannot takeis best
the color too remote
that i could show it in bazaar
a guinea at a sight
the fine  impalpable array
that swaggers on the eye
like cleopatras company
repeated  in the sky
the moments of dominion
that happen on the soul
and leave it with a discontent
too exquisite to teli
the eager look  on landscapes
as if they just repressed
some secret that was pushing
like chariots  in the vest
the pleading of the surnmer
that other prank  of snow
that cushions mystery with tulle
for fear the squirrels  know
their graspless manners  mock us
until the cheated eye
shuts arrogantly  in the grave
another way to see
they called me to the w mdow for
ltwas sunset  some one said
i only saw a sapphire farm
and just a single herd
of opal cattle  feeding far
upon so vain a hill
as even while i looked  dissolved
nor cattle were  nor soil
but in their stead  a sea  displayed
and ships  of such a size
as crew of mountains  could afford
and decks  to seat the skies
this  too  the showman rubbed away
and when i looked again
nor fannnor opal herdwas there
nor mediterranean
i watched the moon around the house
until upon a pane
she stopped  a travellers privilege  for rest
and there upon
i gazedas at a stranger
the lady in the town
doth think no incivility
to lift her glass  upon
but never stranger justified
the curiosity
like mine  for not a foot  nor hand
nor formula  had she
but like a head  a guillotine
slid carelessly away
old mdependent amber
sustain her in the sky
or like a stemless flower
upheld in rolling air
by finer gravitatlons
than bmd philosopher
no hunger  had she  nor an inn
her toilette  to suffice
nor avocationnor concern
for little mysteries
as harass us like life  and death
and afterwards  or n ay
but seemed engrossed to absolute
with shiningand the sky
the pnvilege to scrutlnize
was scarce upon my eyes
when with a silver practise
she vaulted out of gaze
and next  i met her on a cloud
myself too far below
to follow her superior road
or its advantageblue
the llghtnmg playeth  all the while
but when he smgeth  then
ourselves are conscious he exist
and we approach him  stern
with insulatorsand a glove
whose short  sepulchral bass
alarms us  tho his yellow feet
may pass  and counterpass
upon the ropesabove our head
continualwith the news
nor we so much as check our speech
nor stop to cross ourselves
ourselves were wed one summer  dear
your visionwas in june
and when your little lifetime failed
i weaned  too  of mine
and overtaken in the dark
where you had put me down
by some one carrying a ught
i  too  received the sign
tis trueour futures different lay
your cottage  faced the sun
while oceansand the north must be
on every side of mine
tis true your garden led the bloom
for mme  in frosts  was sown
and yet one summer we were queens
but you  were crowned in june
the brain  is wider than the sky
for  put them side by side
the one the other will contain
with ease  and you  beside
the brain is deeper than the sea
for hold them  blue to blue
the one the other will absorb
as sponges buckets  do
the brain is just the weight of god
for heft them  pound for pound
and they will differ  if they do
as syllable from sound
when bells stop ringing  church  begins
the positive  of bells
when cogs  stop  thats circumference
the ultimate  of wheels
youll know her  by her foot
the smallest gamboge hand
with fingerswhere the toes should be
would more affront the sand
than this quaint creatures boot
adjusted by a stem
without a button  i could vouch
unto a velvet limb
youll know her  by her vest
tight fitting  orange  brown
inside a jacket duller
she wore when she was born
her cap is smalland snug
constructed for the winds
shed pass for barehead  short way off
but as she closer stands
so finer tis than w
you cannot feel the seam
nor is it clasped unto of band
nor held uponof brim
youll know her  by her voice
at first  a doubtful tone
a sweet endeavor  but as march
to aprilhurries on
she squanders on your ear
such arguments of pearl
you beg the robin in your bram
to keep the other  still
i think the longest hour of all
is when the cars have come
and we are waiting for the coach
it seems as though the time
indignant  that the joy was come
did block the gilded hands
and would not let the seconds by
but slowest instant  ends
the pendulum begins to count
like little scholars loud
the steps grow thicker  in the hall
the heart begins to crowd
then i  my timid service done
tho service twas of love
take up my little violin
and further northremove
the way i read a letters  this
tis first  i lock the door
and push it with my fingersnext
for transport it be sure
and then i go the furthest off
to counteract a knock
then draw my little letter forth
and slowly pick the lock
then  glancing narrow at the vall
and narrow at the boor
for firm conviction of a mouse
not exorcised before
peruse how infinite i am
to no one that you  know
and sigh for lack of heaven  but not
the heaven god bestow
the chllds faith is new
whole like his princlple
wide  like the sunrise
on fresh eyes
never had a doubt
laughs  at a scruple
believes all sham
but paradise
credits the world
deems his dominion
broadest of sovereignties
and caesar  mean
in the comparison
baseless emperor
ruler of nought
yet swaying all
grown bye and bye
to hold mistaken
his pretty estimates
of prickly things
he gains the skill
sorrowful as certain
men  to anticipate
instead of kmgs
to my small hearth his fire came
and all my house aglow
did fan and rock with sudden light
twas sunrisetwas the sky
impanelled from no summer brief
with limit of decay
twas noon without the news of night
nay nature it was day
my portion is defeat  today
a paler luck than vlctory
less paeans  fewer bells
the drums dont follow me  with tunes
defeat  a somewhat slower  means
more arduous than balls
tis populous with bone and stain
and men too straight to stoop again
and piles of solid moan
and chips of blank  in boyish eyes
and scraps of prayer
and deaths surprise
stamped visible  in stone
theres somewhat prouder over there
the trumpets tell it to the air
how different victory
to him who has it and the one
who to have had it would have been
contenteder  to die
i cannot live with you
it would be life
and life is over there
behind the shelf
the sexton keeps the key to
putting up
our life  his porcelain
like a cup
discarded of the housewife
quaintor broke
a newer sevres pleases
old ones crack
i could not die  with you
for one must wait
to shut the others gaze down
youcould not
and i  could i stand by
and see you  freeze
without my right of frost
deaths privilege
nor could i risewith you
because your face
would putout jesus
that new grace
glow plain  and foreign
on my homesick eye
except that you than he
shone closer by
theyd judge ushow
for youserved heavenyou know
or sought to
i could not
because yl satura sight
and i had no moreey
for sordid excellence
as paradise
and were you lost i would be
though my name
rang loudest
on the heavenly fame
and were you  saved
and i  condemned to be
where you were not
that selfwere hell to me
so we must meet apart
you thereihere
with just the door ajar
that oceans are  and prayer
and that white sustenance
despair
size circumscribes  it has no room
for petty furniture
the giant tolerates no gnat
for ease of gianture
repudiates it all the more
because intrinsic size
ignores the possibility
of calumnies  or flies
me from myselfto banish
had i art
impregnable my fortress
unto all heart
but since myselfassault me
how have i peace
except by subjugating
consciousness
and since were mutual monarch
how this be
except by abdication
meof me
i could suffice for him i knew
he  could suffice for me
yet hesitating fractions  both
surveyed infinity
would i be whole he sudden broached
my syllable rebelled
twas face to face with nature  forced
twas face to face with god
withdrew the sunto other wests
withdrew the furthest star
before decision  stooped to speech
and then  be audibler
the answer of the sea unto
the motion of the moon
herself adjust her tides  unto
could i  do else  with mine
you left me  sire  two legacies
a legacy of love
a heavenly father would suffice
had he the ofter of
you left me boundaries of pain
capacious as the sea
between eternity and time
your consciousness  and me
bereavement in their death to feel
whom we have never seen
a vital kmsmanship import
our soul and theirs  between
for stranger  strangers do not mourn
there be immortal friends
whom death see first  tis news of this
that paralyze ourselves
who vital only to our thought
such presence bear away
in dying  tis as if our souls
absconded  suddenly
i think to live  may be a bliss
to those who dare to try
beyond my limit to conceive
my lip  to testify
i think the heart i fonner wore
could widen  till to me
the other like the little bank
appearunto the sea
l thldk the days  could every one
in ordination stand
and majesty  be easier
than an inferior kind
no numb alarm lest difference come
no goblinon the bloom
no start in apprehensions ear
no bankruptcy  no doom
but certainties of sun
midsummer  in the mind
a steadfast south  upon the soul
her polar time  behind
the vision  pondered long
so plausible becomes
that i esteem the fiction  real
the real fictitious seems
how bountiful the dream
what plentyit would be
had all my life but been mistake
just rectified  in thee
a little road  not made of man
enabled of the eye
accessible to thill of bee
or cart of butterry
if town it have  beyond itself
tis thati cannot say
i only knowno curricle that rumble there
bear me
promise this when you be dying
some shall summon me
mine belong your latest sighing
mineto belt your eye
not with coms  though they be minted
from an emperors hand
be my lipsthe only buckle
your low eyesdemand
mine to stay  when all have wandered
to devise once more
if the life be too surrendered
life of mine  restore
poured like this  my whole libation
just that you should see
bliss of death  lifes bliss extol thro
imitating you
mine  to guard your narrow precinct
to seduce the sun
longest on your south to linger
largest dews of morn
to demand in your low favor
lest the jealous grass
greener lean  or fonder cluster
round some other face
mine to supplicate madonna
if madonna be
could behold so far a creature
christ  omitted  me
just to follow your dear feature
neer so far behind
for my heaven

her sweet turn to leave the homestead
came the darker way
carriages  be sure  and guests  too
but for holiday
tis more pitiful endeavor
than did loaded sea
oer the curls attempt to caper
it had cast away
never bride had such assembling
never kinsmen kneeled
to salute so fair a forehead
garland be indeed
fitter feetof her before us
than whatever brow
art of snow  or trick of lily
possibly bestow
of her father whoso ask her
he shall seek as high
as the palm  that serve the desert
to obtain the sky
distance  be her only motion
if tis nayor yes
acquiescence  or demurral
whosoever guess
he  must pass the crystal angle
that obscure her face
he  must have achieved in person
equal paradise
pain  has an element of blank
it cannot recollect
when it begun  or if there were
a time when it was not
it has no future  but itself
its infinite contain
its past  enlightened to perceive
new periodsof pain
so much summer
me for showing
illegitimate
would a smiles minute bestowing
too exorbitant
to the lady
with the guinea
look if she should know
crumb of mine
a robins larder
would suffice to stow
a prison gets to be a friend
between its ponderous face
and ours  a kinsmanship express
and in its narrow eyes
we come to look with gratitude
for the appointed beam
it deal us  stated as our food
and hungered for  the same
we learn to know the planks
that answer to our feet
so miserable a sound  at first
nor ever now  so sweet
as plashing in the pools
when memory was a boy
but a demurer circuit
a geometric joy
the posture of the key
that interrupt the day
to our endeavor  not so real
the cheek of liberty
as this phantasm steel
whose features  day and night
are present to us  as our own
and as escapeless  quite
the narrow round  the stint
the slow exchange of hope
for something passiver  content
too steep for looking up
the liberty we knew
avoided like a dream
too wide for any night but heaven
if that  indeed  redeem
of being is a bird
the likest to the down
an easy breeze do put afloat
the general heavens  upon
it soars  and shifts  and whirls
and measures with the clouds
in easy  even  dazzling pace
no different the birds
except a wake of music
accompany their feet
as did the down emit a tune
for ecstasy  ofit
a long long sleep  a famous  sleep
that makes no show for mom
by stretch of limb  or stir of lid
an independent one
vas ever idleness like this
upon a bank of stone
to bask the centunes away
nor once look upfor noon
without this  there is nought
all other riches be
as is the twitter of a brrd
heard opposite the sea
i could not care  to gain
a lesser than the whole
for did not this include themself
as seamsinclude the ball
i wished a way might be
my heart to subdivide
twould magnify  the gratitude
and not reduce  the gold
the nameof itis autumn
the hue  of it  is blood
an artery  upon the hill
a vein  along the road
great globules  in the alleys
and oh the shower of stain
when winds  upset the basin
and spill the scarlet rain
it sprinkles bonnets  far below
it gathers ruddy pools
then  edrues like a rose  away
upon vermilion wheels
i dwell in possibility
a fairer house than prose
more numerous of windows

and for an everlasting roof

to gather paradise
whole gulfs  of red and fleets  of red
and crews  of solid blood
did place about the west tonight
as twere specific ground
and they  appointed creatures
in authorized arrays

that bowsand disappears
that first day when you praised me sweet
and said that i was strong
and could be mighty if i liked
that day  the days among
glows centrallike a jewel
between diverging golds
the minor one  that gleamed behind
and vasterof the worlds
tis good  the looking back on gnef
to reendure a day
ve thought the mighty funeral
of all conceived joy
to recollect how busy grass
did meddle  one by one
till all the grief with summer  waved
and none could see the stone
and though the woe you have today
be larger  as the sea
exceeds its unremembered drop
theyre waterequally
could i but ride indefinite
as doth the meadow bee
and visit only where i liked
and no one visit me
and birt all day with buttercups
and marry whom i may
and dwell a little everywhere
or better run away
with no plice to follow
or chase hun if he do
till he should jump peninsulas
to get away from me
l said but just to be a bee
upon a raft of air
and row in nowhere all day long
and anchor off the bar

who tight in dungeons are

i feel the old deuee
i hear him ask the servant
for such an one  as me
i take a oweras i go
my face to justify
he never saw me  in this life
i might surprise his eye
i cross the hall with mingled steps
i  silent  pass the door
i look on all this world contains
just his face  nothing more
we talk in careless  and in toss
a kind of plummet strain
each  soundmg  shyly
just  how  deep

a tender  thoughtful moon
goes with us  just a little way
and  then  we are alone
alone  if angels are alone
first tmze they try the sky
alone  if those veiled faces  be
ve cannot count  on high
d give  to live that hour  again
the purple  in my vein
but he must count the drops  himself
my price for every stam
of all the souls that stand create
i have elected  one
when sense from spint  files away
and subterfuge  is done
when that which is  and that which was
apart  mtrinsic  stand
and this brief drama in the flesh
is shifted like a sand
when figures show their royal front
and mists  are carved away
behold the atom  i preferred
to all the lists of clay
dropped into the ether acre
wearing the sod gown
bonnet of everlastmg laces
brooch  frozen on
horses of blonde  and coach of silver
baggage a strapped pearl
journey of down  and whip of diamond

the sun kept setting  setting  still
no hue of afternoon
upon the village i perceived
from house to house twas noon
the dusk kept dropping  dropping  stlll
no dew upon the grass
but only on my forehead stopped
and wandered in my face
my feet kept drowsing  drowsmg  still
my fingers were awake
yet why so litde soundmyself
unto my seemingmake
how well i knew the light before
i could see it now
tis dyingi am doingbut
im not afraid to know
shells from the coast mistaking
i cherished them for all
happening in mter ages
to entertain a pearl
wherefore so late  i murmured
my need of thee be done
therefore  the pearl responded
my period begin
the heaven vests for each
in that small deity
it craved the grac to orship
some bashful summers day
half shrinlung from the glory
it importuned to see
till these faint tabernacles drop
in full eternlty
hmv imminent the venture
as one should sue a star
for his mean sake to leave the row
and entertain despair
a clemency so common
we almost cease to fear
enabling the mmutest
and furthest  to adore
as if the sea should part
and show a further sea
and that  a further  and the three
but a presumption be
of periods of seas
unvisited of shores
themselves the verge of seas to be
eternity  is those
their height in heaven comforts not
their glory  nought to me
twas best imperfectas it was
fm finitei cant see
the house of supposition
the glimmering frontier that
skirts the acres of perhaps
to meshows msecure
the wealth i had  contented me
if twas a meaner size
then i had counted it until
it pleased my narrow eyes
better than larger values
that show however true
this timid life of evidence
keeps pleading i dont know
i could bring you jewels  had i a mind to
but you have enough  of those
i could bring you odors from st dommgo
colors  from vera cruz
bernes of the bahamas  have
but this little blaze
flickering to itself  m the meadow
suits me  more than those
never a fellow matched this topaz
and his emerald swing
dower itself  for bobadilo
better  could i bring
life  is what we make it
death  we do not know
christs acquaintance with him
justify himthough
he  would trust no stranger
othercould betray
just his own endorsement
thatsufficeth me
all the other distance
he hath traversed first
no new mile remaineth
far as paradise
his sure foot preceding
tender pioneer
base must be the coward
dare not venture  now
the judge is like the owl
ive heard my father tell
and owls do build in oaks
so heres an amber sill
that slanted  my path
when gomg to the bam
and if it serve you for a house
itself is not in vain
about the price  tis small
i only ask atune
at midnight  let the owl select
his favorite refrain
youve seen balloons set  havent you
so stately they ascend
it is as swans  discarded you
for duties diamond
their liquid feet go softly out
upon a sea of bnde
they spurn the air as twere too mean
for creatures so renowned
their ribbons just beyond the eye
they struggle  some  for breath
and yet the crowd applaud bew
they would not encore  death
the gilded creature strains  and spms
trips frantic in a tree
tears open her imperial vems
and tumbles in the sea
the crowd  retire with an oath
the dust in streets  go down
and clerks in counting rooms
observe twas only a balloon
a thought went up my mind today
that i have had before
but did not finish  some way back
i could not fix the year
nor where it went  nor why it came
the second time to me
nor definitely what it was
have i the art to say
but somewhere  in my soul i know
ive met the thing before
it just reminded me  twas all
and came my way no more
a first mute coming
in the strangers house
a first fair going
when the bells rejoice
a first exchange  of
what hath mingled  been
for lotexhibited to
faith  alone
out of sight what of that
see the bird  reach it
curve by curve  sweep by sweep
round the steep fur
danger what is that to her
better tis to faii there
than debate  here
blue is blue  the world through
amber  amber  dew  dew
seek  friend  and see
heaven is shy of earth  thats all
bashful heaven  thy lovers small
hide  too  from thee
no matternowsweet

wont you wish youd spoken
to that dull girl
trivial a word  just

but wont you wish youd spaled one

the thought to be alive
anonymous delight to know
and madder  to conceive
consoles a woe so monstrous

erects in iodine

both lie
strong draughts of their refreshing minds

how powerful the stimulus

he kindly stopped for me
the carriage held but just ourselves
and immortality
we slowly drove  he knew no haste
and i had put away
my labor and my leisure too

at recess  in the rmg
we passed the fields of gazmg gram

her petticoat  of purple plam
her dimities  as old
exactly  as the world
and vet the newest star
enrolled upon the hemisphere
be wrinkled  much as her
too near to god  to pray
too near to heaven  to fear
the lady of the occident
retired without a care
her candle so expire
the flickering be seen
on ball of mast in bosporus
and dome and window pane
the beggar lad  dies early
its somewhat in the cold
and somewhat in the trudging feet
and haply in the world
the cruel smiling  bowing world
that took its cambric way
nor heard the timid cry for bread
sweet lady  charity
among redeemed children
it trudging feet may stand
the barefoot time forgotten  so
the sleet  the bitter wind
the childish hands that teased for pence
lifted adoring  then
to him whom never raggedcoat
did supplicate in vain
i meant to find her when i came
death  had the same design
but the successwas hisit seems
and the surrender  mine
i meant to tell her how i longed
for just this single time
but death had told her so the first
and she had past with him
to wander  now is my repose
to rest  to rest would be
a privilege of hurricane

the flowers  appealed  a timid throng
i reinforced the door
go blossom to the bees  i said
and trouble me  no more
the summer grace for notice strove
remote  her best array
the heart to stimulate the eye
refused too utteriy
at length a mourner like myself
she drew away austere
her frosts to ponder  then it was
i recollected her
she suffered me for i had mourned
i offered her no word
my witnesswas the crape i bore
her witnesswas her dead
thenceforward  we  together dwelt
i never questioned her
our contract
a wiser sympathy
remorse  is memory  awake
her parties all astir
a presence of departed acts
at wmdow  and at door
its past  set down before the soul
and lighted with a match
perusal to facilitate
and help belief to stretch
remorse is cureless  the disease
not even god  can heal
for tis his institutionand
the adequate of hell
renunciation  is a piercing virtue
the letting go
a presence  for an etation
not now
the putting out of eyes
just sunrise
lest day
days great progenitor
outvie
renunciation  is the choosing
agamst itself
itself to lustifv
unto itself
when larger function
make that appear
smallerthat covered vlsionhere
never for society
he shall seek in vam
who his own acquaintance
cultivate  of men
wiser men may weary
but the man within
never knew satiety
better entertain
than could border ballad
or biscayan hymn
neither introduction
need you  unto him
it dropped so low in my regard
i heard it hit the ground
and go to pieces on the stones
at bottom of my mind
yet blamed the fate that hung it less
than i denounced myself
for entertaining plated wares
upon my silver shelf
autumnoverlooked my knitting
dyes  said he  have
could disparage a flamingo
show me them  said
cochineal i chose  for deeming
it resemble thee
and the little border  dusker
for resembling me
all but death can be adjusted
dynasties repaired
systems  settled in their sockets
citadels  dissolved
wastes of lives  resown with colors
by succeeding spnngs
death  unto itself  exceptlon
is exempt from change
growth of manlike growth of nature
gravitates within
atmosphere and sun endorse it
but it stir  alone
eachits difficultideal
must achieveitself
through the solitary prowess
of a silent life
effort  is the sole condition
patience of itself
patience of opposing forces
and intact belief
looking on is the department
of its audience
but transaction  is assisted
by no countenance
my worthiness is all my doubt
his merit  all mv fear
contrasting which my quality
do lowlier  appear
lest i should insufficient prove
for his beloved need
the chiefest apprehension
upon my thronging mind
tis true  that deity to stoop
inherently inchne
for nothing higher than itself
itself can rest upon
so i  the undivine abode
of his elect content
conform my soulas twere a church
unto her sacrament
so the eyes accostand sunder
in an audience
stamped  occasionally  forever
so may countenance
entertain  without addressing
countenance of one
in a neighboring horizon
gone  as soon as known
my soul accused me  and i quailed
as tongues of diamond had reviled
all else accused me  and i smiled
my soul that moming was my friend
her favor  is the best disdain
toward artifice of time  or men
but her disdain   twere lighter bear
a finger of enamelled fire
my life had stood  a loaded gun
in corners  till a day
the owner passed  identified
and carried me away
and now we roam in sovereign woods
and now we hunt the doe
and every time i speak for him
the mountains straight reply
and do i smile such cordial light
upon the valley glow
it is as a vesuvian face
had let its pleasure through
and when at nightour good day done
i guard my masters head
tis better than the eiderducks
deep pillow  to have shared
to foe of his  im deadly foe
none stir the second time
on whom ilaya yellow eye
or an emphatic thumb
though i than he  may longer live
he longer must  than
for i haye but the power to kill
v lthout  the power to die
no bobolmkreverse his smging
when the only tree
ever he minded occupymg
by the farmer be
clove to the root
his spacious future
best honzon  gone
whose music be his
only anodyne
brave bobolink
one blessing had i than the rest
so larger to my eyes
thad stopped gaugingsatisfied
for this enchanted size
it was the limit of my dream
the focus of my prayer
a perfect  paralyzing bliss
contented as despair
i knew no more of want  or cold
phantasms both become
for this new value in the soul
supremest earthly sum
the heaven below the heaven above
obscured with ruddier blue
lifes latitudes leant over  full
the judgment perished  too
why bliss so scantily dlsburse
why paradise defer
why floods be served to us in bowls
i speculate no more
the mountains  grow unnotlced
their purple figures ilse
without attempt  exhaustlon
assistance  or applause
in their eternal faces
the sun with just delight
looks longand lastand golden
for fellowship  at night
thesesawvisions
latch them softly
theseheld dimples
smooth them slow
this  addressed departmg accents
quick  sweet mouth  to miss thee so
this  we stroked
unnumbered satin
these  we held among our own
fingers of the slim aurora

paradise  the only palace
fit for her reception  now
he fought like those whove nought to lose
bestowed himself to balls
as one who for a further life
had not a further use
invited death  with bold attempt
but death was coy of him
as other men were coy of death
to himto livewas doom
his comrades shifted like the flakes
when gusts reverse the snow
but he  was left alive because
of greediness to die
most she touched me by her muteness
most she won me by the way
she presented her small figure
plea itself  for charity
were a crumb my whole possession
were there famine in the land
were it my resource from starving
could i such a plea withstand
not upon her knee to thank me
sank this beggar from the sky
but the crumb partook  departed
and returned on high
i supposed  when sudden
such a praise began
twas as space sat singing
to herself  and men
twas the winged beggar
afterward i learned
to her benefactor
malung gratitude
from blank to blank
a threadless way
i pushed mechamc feet
to stop  or pensh  or advance
alike indifferent
if end i gained
it ends beyond
indefimte disclosed
i shut my eyes  and groped as well
twas lighterto be blind
the whole of it came not at once
twas murder by degrees
a thrust  and then for life a chance
the bliss to cauterize
the cat reprieves the mouse
she eases from her teeth
just long enough for hope to tease
then mashes it to death
tis lifes award  to die
contenteder if once
than dying half  then rallying
for consciouser eclipse

he told a homely tale
j        and spotted it with tears
upon his infant face was set
the cicatrice of years
all crumpled was the cheek
no other kiss had known
than flake of snow divided with
the redbreast of the bam
if mother  in the grave
or father  on the sea
or father in the finnament
or brethren had he
if commonwealth below
or commonwealth above
have missed a barefoot citizen
ive ransomed it  alive
presentiment  is that long shadow  on the lawn
indicative that suns go down
the notice to the startled grass
that darkness  is about to pass
you constituted time
i deemed eternity
a revelation of yourself
twas therefore deity
the absolute  removed
the relative away
that i unto himself adjust
my slow idolatry
my faith is larger than the hlils
so when the hills decay
my faith must take th purple wheel
to show the sun the way
tis first he steps upon the vane
and then  upon the hill
and then abroad the world he go
to do his golden will
and if his yellow feet should miss
the bird would not arise
the flowers would slumber on their stems
no bells have paradlse
how dare i therefore stint a faith
on which so vast depends
lest firmament should fall for me
the rivet in the bands
to offer brave assistance
to lives that stand alone
when one has failed to stop them
is human  but divine
to lend an ample sinew
unto a nameless man
whose homely benediction
no other  stopped to earn
when i hoped i recollect
just the place i stood
at a window facing west
roughest air  was good
not a sleet could bite me
not a frost could cool
hope it was that kept me warm
not menno shawl
when i feared  i recollect
just the day it was
worlds were lying out to sun
yet how nature froze
icicles upon my soul
prickled blue and cooi
bird went praising everywhere
only mewas still
and the day that i despaired
this  if i forget
nature will that it be night
after sun has set
darkness intersect her face
and putout her eye
nature hesitate  before
memory and
one and one  are one
two  be finished using
well enough for schools
but for minor choosing
lifejustor death
or the everlasting
more  would be too vast
for the souls comprising
i lived on dread
to those who know
the stimulus there is
in danger  other impetus
is numb  and vitalless
as twere a spurupon the soul
a fear will urge it where
to go without the spectres aid
were challengmg despair
none can experience stint
who bountyhave not known
the fact of famine  could not be
except for fact of com
wantis a meagre art
acquired by reverse
the poverty that was not wealth
cannot be indigence
the hallowing of pain
like hallowing of heaven
obtains at a corporeal cost
the summit is not given
to him who strives severe
at middle of the hill
but he who has achieved the top
all is the price of all
deprived of other banquet
i entertained myself
at first  a scant nutrition
an insufficient loaf
but grown by slender addings
to so esteemed a size
tis sumptuous enough for me
and almost to suffice
a robms famine able
red pilgrim he and
a berry from our table
reserve  for charity
it is a lonesome glee
yet sanctifies the mind
with fair association
mar upon the wind
a bird to overhear
delight without a cause
arrestless as mvisible
a matter of the skies
if blame be my side  forfeit me
but doom me not to forfeit thee
to forfeit thee the very name
is sentence from beliefand home
purple
the color of a queen is this
the color of a sun
at settmg  this and amber
beryl and this at noon
and when at mght  auroran vidths
flmg suddenly on men
tis thisand witchcraftnature keeps
a rank  for iodine
the loneliness one dare not sound
and would as soon surmise
as in its grave go plumbing
to ascertain the size
the loneliness whose worst alarm
is lest itself should see
and perish from before itself
for just a scrutmy
the horror not to be suneyed
but skirted in the dark
with consciousness suspended
and being under lock
i fear me this  is loneliness
the maker of the soul
its caverns and its corridors
tiluminate  or seal
this that would greet  an hour ago
is quaintest distance  now
had it a guest from paradise
nor glow would it nor bow
had it a notice from the noon
nor beam would it nor wann
match me the sliver reticence
match me the sohd calm
the seivlce without hope
is tenderest i think
because tis unsustained
by stintrewarded work
has impetus of gain
and impetus of goal
there is no diligence like that
that knows not an untii
the truthis stirless
other force  may be presumed to move
this  then  is best for confidence
when oldest cedars swerve
and oaks untwist their fists
and mountains  feeble lean
how excellent a body that
stands wlthout a bone
how vigorous a force
that holds without a prop
truth stays herself  and every man
that trusts her  boldly up
to wait an hour  is long
if love be just beyond
to walt eternityis short
if love reward the end
there is an arid pleasure
as different from joy
as frost is different from dew
like element  are they
yet one  rejoices flowers
and one  the flowers abhor
the finest honey  curdled
is worthless  to the bee
the birds begun at four oclock
their penod for dawn
a music numerous as space
but neighboring as noon
i could not count their force
their voices did expend
as brook by brook bestows itself
to multiply the pond
their witnesses were not
except occasional man
in homely industry arrayed
to overtake the morn
nor was it for applause
that i could ascertain
but independent ecstasy
of deity and men
by six the flood had done
no tumult there had been
asr
of dressmg or departure
and yet the band was gone
the sun engrossed the east
the dav controlled the world
the mlacle that mtroduced
forgotten as fulfilled
bereaved of all i went abroad
no less bereaved was i
upon a new peninsula
the grave preceded me
obtamed my lodgings ere myself
and when i sought my bed
the grave it was reposed upon
the pillow for my head
i waked to find it first awake
i rose  it followed me
i tried to drop it in the crowd
to loseitin the sea
in cups of artificial drowse
to steep its shape away
the grave  was finished  but the spade
remained in memory
they have a litde odor  that to me
ismetrenay tis melody
and spiciest at fading  indicate
a habitof a laureate
severer service of myself
i  hastened to demand
to fill the awful vacuum
your life had left behind
i worried nature with my vheels
when hers had ceased to run
when she had put away her work
my own had just begun
i strove to weary brain and bone
to harass to fatigue
the glittering retinue of nerves
vitality to clog
to some dull comfort those obtain
who put a head away
they knew the hair to
and forget the color of the day
affuction would not be appeased
the darkness braced as firm
as all my stratagem had been
the midnight to confirm
no drug for consciousness  can be
alternative to die
is natures only pharmacy
for beings malady
such is the force of happiness
the least  can lift a ton
assisted by its stimulus
who misery  sustain
no sinew can afford
the cargo of themselves
too mfinite for consciousness
slow capabilities
joy to have merited the pain
to merit the release
joy to have penshed every step
to compass paradise
pardon  to look upon thy face
with these old fashioned eyes
better than new  could be  for that
though bought in paradise
because they looked on thee before
and thou hast looked on them
prove memy hazel witnesses
the features are the same
so beet thou wert when present
so mfinite  when gone
an orients apparition
remanded of the morn
the height i recollect
twas even with the hills
the depth upon my soul was notched
as floodson whites of wheels
to haunt  till time have dropped
his last decade away
and haunting actualize  to last
at leastetemity
on a columnar self
how ample to rely
in tumultor extremity
how good the certainty
that lever cannot pry
and wedge cannot divide
conviction  that gramtic base
though none be on our side
suffice usfor a crowd
ourself  and rectitude
and that assemblynot far off
from furthest spirit  god
nature  the gentlest mother is
impatient of no child
the feeblestor the waywardest
her admonition mild
in forest  and the hill
by t raveller be heard
restraining rampant squirrel
or too impetuous bird
how fair her conversation
a summer mternoon
her householdher assembly
and when the sun go down
her voice among the aisles
incite the timid prayer
of the minutest cricket
the most unworthy flower
when all the children sleep
she turns as long away
as will suffice to light her lamps
then bending from the sky
with infinite affection
and infiniter care
her golden finger on her lip
vills silenceeverywhere
god gave a loaf to every bird
but just a crumb  to me
i dare not eat ittho i starve
my poignant luxury
to own ittouch it
prove the feat that made the pellet mme
too happy for my sparrows chance
for ampler coveting
it might be famine  all around
i could not miss an ear
such plenty smiles upon my board
my garner shows so fair
i wonder how the rich  may feel
an indlaman  an earl
i deem thatiwith but a crumb
am sovereign of them all
through the strait pass of suffering
the martyrs even  trod
their feet  upon temptation
their facesupon cod
a stately  shriven  company
convulsion  playing round
harmless as streaks of meteor
upon a planets bond
their faith  the everlasting troth
their expectation  fair
the needle  to the north degree
wades  so  thro polar air
grief is a mouse
and chooses wamscot  the breast
for his shy house
and baffles quest
grief is a thief  quick startled
pricks his ear  report to hear
of that vast dark
that swept his being  back
grief is a juggler  boldest at the play
lest if he hinch  the eye that way
pounce on his bruises  one  say  or three
gnef is a gourmand  spare his luxury
best grief is tongueless before hell tell
burn him in the public square
his ashes  will
possibly  if they refuse  how then kno
since a rack couldnt coax a syllable  now
a drop fell on the apple tree
another  on the roof
a half a dozen kissed the eaves
and made the gables laugh
a few went out to help the brook
that went to help the sea
myself conjectured were they pearls
what necklaces could be
the dust replaced in hoisted roads
the birds jocoser sung
the sunshine threw his hat away
the bushes  spangles flung
the breezes brought dejected lutes
and bathed them in the glee
then onent showed a single flag
and signed the fete away
her final summer was it
and yet we guessed it not
if tenderer industriousness
pervaded her we thought
a further force of life
developed from within
when death lit all the shortness up
it made the hurry plain
we wondered at our blindness
when nothing was to see
but her carrara guide post
at our stupidity
when duller than our dullness
the busy darling lay
so busy was she  finishing
so leisurely  were we
who giants know with lesser men
are incomplete and shy
for greatness that is ill at ease
in minor company
a smaller could not be perturbed
the summer gnat displays
unconscious that his single fleet
do not comprise the skies

the undiscovered continent
no settler had the mind
perhaps you think me stooping
im not ashamed of that
chnst  stooped until he touched the grave
do those at sacrament
commemorate dishonor
or love annealed of love
until it bend as low as death
redignified above
c z                                                  r
before he comes we weigh the time
tis heavy and tis light
when he depart an emptiness
is the prevailing freight
nature and god  i neither knew
yet both so well knew me
they startled like executors
of my identity
yet neither told  that i could learn
my secret as secure
as herschels private interest
or mercurys affair
truth  is as old as god
his twin identity
and will endure as long as he
a coeternity
and perish on the day
himself is borne away
from mansion of the universe
a lifeless deity
how well i knew her not
whom not to know has been
a bounty in prospective now
next door to mine the pain
impossibility like wine
exhilarates the man
who tastes it possibility
is flavorless  combine
a chances faintest tincture
and in the former dram
enchantment makes ingredient
as certainly as doom
always mine
no more vacation
term of light this day begun
failiess as the fair rotation
of the seasons and the sun
old the grace but new the subjects
old indeed the east
yet upon his purple programme
every dawn is first
i cannot buy it  tis not sold
there is no other in the world
mine was the only one
i was so happy i forgot
to shut the door and it went out
and i am all alone
if i could find it anywhere
i would not mind the journey there
though it took all my store
but just to look it in the eye
didst thou thou didst not mean to say
then turn my face away
a moth the hue of this
haunts candles in brazil
natures expenence would make
our reddest second pale
nature is fond i sometimes think
of trinkets as a girl
good to hide and hear em hunt
better to be found
if one care to that is
the fox fits the hound
good to know and not tell
best to know and tell
can one find the rare ear
not too dull
i made slow riches but my gain
was steady as the sun
and every night it numbered more
than the preceding one
all days i did not earn the same
but my perceiveless gain
inferred the less by growing than
the sum that it had grown
spring is the period
express from god
among the other seasons
himself abide
but dunng march and april
none strr abroad
without a cordialmterview
with god
be mine the doom
sufficient fame
to perish in her hand
twice had summer her fair verdure
proffered to the plain
twice a winters silver fracture
on the rivers been
two full autumns for the squirrel
bounteous prepared
nature hadst thou not a berry
for thy wandering bird
finiteto fail but infinite to venture
for the one ship that struts the shore
manys the gallantoverwhelmed creature
nodding in navies nevermore
just as he spoke it from his hands
this edifice remain
a turret more a turret less
dishonor his design
according as his skill prefer
it perish or endure
content soeer it ornament
his absent character
the good will of a flower
the man who would posess
must first present
certificate
of minted holiness
i sing to use the waiting
my bonnet but to tie
and shut the door unto my house
no more to do have i
till his best step approaching
we journey to the day
and tell each other how we sung
to keep the dark away
when the astronomer stops seeking
for his pleiads face
when the lone british lady
forsakes the arctic race
when to his covenant needle
the sailor doubting turns
it will be amply early
to ask what treason means
apology for her
be rendered by the bee
herself without a parhament
apology for me
when one has given up ones life
the parting with the rest
feels easy as when day lets go
entirely the west
the peaks that lingered last
remain in her regret
as scarcely as the iodine
upon the cataract
banish air from air
divide light if you dare
theyll meet
while cubes in a drop
or pellets of shape
fit
films cannot annul
odors return whole
force flame
and with a blonde push
over your impotence
hits steam
to own the art within the soul
the soul to entertain
vith silence as a company
and festival maintain
is an unfurmshed circumstance
possession is to one
as an estate perpetual
or a reduceless mine
there is a finished feeling
experienced at graves
a leisure of the future
a wilderness of size
by deaths bold exhibition
preciser what we are
and the eternal function
enabled to infer
unceltain leasedevelops lustre
on time
uncertain grasp appreciation
of sum
the shorter fate  is oftener the chiefest

this chasm sweet upon my life
i mention it to you
vhen sunrise through a fissure drop
the day must follow too
if we demur its gaping sides
disclose as twere a tomb
ourself am lymg straight wherein
the favorite of doom
when it has just contained a life
then darlmg it will close
and yet so bolder every day
so turbulent it grows
im tempted half to stitch it up
with a remaining breath
i should not miss in leiding though
to him it would be death
and so i bear it big about
m v burial before
a life quite ready to depart
can harass me no more
a doubt if it be us
assists the staggering mind
in an extremer anguish
until it footing find
an unreality is lent
a merciful mirage
that makes the livmg possible
vlule it suspends the lives
absence disembodies  so does death
hiding mdividuals from the earth
superstition helps as well as loye
tenderness decreases as we prove
split the lark  and youll find the music
bulb after bulb in sliver rolled
scantily dealt to the summer mornmg
saved for your ear when lutes be old
loose the flood  you shall find it patent
gush after gush reserved for you

now do you doubt that your bird was true
light is sufficien t to itself
if others want to see
it can be had on window panes
some hours in the day
but not for compensation
it holds as large a glow
to squirrel in the himmaleh
precisey as to you
that distance was between us
that is not of mlle or main
the will it is that situates
equator  never can
the robin for the crumb
returns no syllable
but long records the ladys name
in silver chronicle
he outstripped time with but a bout
he outstripped stars and sun
and then unjaded challenged god
in presence of the throne
and he and he in mighty list
unto this present run
the larger glory for the less
a just sufficient ring
fame is the tint that scholars leave
upon their setting names
the iris not of occident
that disappears as comes
escaping backward to perceive
the sea ppon our place
escaping forward to confront
his glittering embrace
retreating up a billows height
retreatmg blmded down
our undermining feet to meet
instructs to the divine
they ask but our delight
the darlings of the soil
and grant us all their countenance
for a penurious smile
because the bee may blameless hum
for thee a bee do i become

because the flowers unafraid
may lift a look on thine a maid
alway a flower would be
nor robins robins need not hide
when thou upon their crypts intrude
so wings bestow on me

his eye it is the east and west

doconcentrate his countenance
like glow vonns flee away
oh poor and far
oh hindered eye
that hunted for the day
the lord a candle entertams
entirely for thee
as the starved maelstrom laps the lavies
as the vulture teased
forces the broods in lonely valleys
as the tiger eased
by but a crumb of blood fasts scarlet
till he meet a man
dainty adorned with veins and tissues
and partakes  his tongue
cooled by the morsel for a moment
grows a fiercer thing
till he esteem his dates and cocoa
a nutrition mean
i of a finer famme
deem my supper dry
for but a berry of domingo
and a torrid eye
ribbons of the year
multitude brocade
worn to natures party once
then as hung aside
as a faded bead
or a wrinkled pearl
who shall charge the vanity
of the makers girl
they wont frown always  some sweet day
when i forget to tease
theyll recollect how cold i looked
and how i just said please
then they will hasten to the door
to call the little girl
who cannot thank them for the ice
that filled the lisping full
i stepped from plank to plank
a slow and cautious way
the stars about my head i felt
about my feet the sea
i knew not but the next
would be my final inch
this gave me that precarious galt
some call experience
it was a grave yet bore no stone
enclosed twas not of rail
a consciousness its acre and
i t held a human soul
entombed by whom for what offence
if home or foreign born
had i the curiosity
twere not appeased of men
till resurrection i must guess
denied the small desire
a rose upon its ridge to sow
or take away a briar
c r                                        r
each scar ill keep for him
instead ill say of gem

a costlier one
but every tear i bore
were he to count them oer
his own would fall so more
ill mis sum them
the sun is gay or stark
according to our deed
if merry he is merrier
if eager for the dead
or an epended day
he helped to make too bnght
his mighty pleasure suits us not
it magnifies our freight
each second is the last
perhaps recalls the man
just measuring unconsciousness
the sea and spar between
to fall within a chance
how terribler a thmg
than perish from the chances hst
before the perishing
the bird must sing to earn the crumb
what merit have the tune
no breakfast if it guaranty
the rose content may bloom
to gam renown of ladys drawer
but if the lady come
but once a century the rose
superbuous become
ive none to tell me to but thee
so when thou fallest nobody
it was a little tie
it just held two nor those it held
since somewhere thy sweet face has spilled
beyond my boundary
if things were opposite  and me
and me it llere  that ebbed from thee
on some unanswering shore
wouldst thou seek so  just say
that i the answer may pursue
unto the lips it eddied through
so  overtaking thee
a shade upon the mind there passes
as when on noon
a cloud the mighty sun encloses
remembering
that some there be too numb to notice
ohgod
why give if thou must take away
the loved
the poets light but lamps
themselves  go out
the vicks they stimulate
if vital light
inhere as do the suns
each age a lens
disseminatmg their
circumference
an everywhere of silver
with ropes of sand
to keep it from effacing
the track called land
our little kinsmen  after rain
in plenty may be seen
a pink and pulpy multitude
the tepid ground upon
a needless life it seemed to me
until a little bird
as to a hospitality
advanced and breakfasted
as i of he so god of me
i pondered may have judged
and left the little angle worm
with modesties enlarged
these tested our horizon
then disappeared
as birds before achieving
a latitude
our retrospection of them
a fixed delight
but our anticipation
a dice  a doubt
we outgrow love like other things
and put it in the drawer
till it an antique fashion shows
like costumes grandsires wore
when i have seen the sun emerge
from his amazing house
and leave a day at every door
a deed in every place
without the incident of fame
or accident of noise
the earth has seemed to me a drum
pursued of little boys
crisis is a hair
toward which the forces creep
past which forces retrograde
if it corne in sleep
to suspend the breath
is the most we can
ignorant is it ufe or death
nicely balancing
let an instant push
or an atom press
or a circle hesitate
in circumference
itmay jolt the hand
that adjusts the hair
that secures eternity
from presenting  here
from us she wandered now a year
her tarrymg unknown
if vllderness prevent her feet
or that ethereal zone
o eve hath seen and lived
ite ignorant must be
we only know what time of year
we took the mystery
to my quick ear the leaves  conferred
the bushes  they were bells
i could not find privacy
from natures sentinels
in cave if i presumed to hide
the vi ails  begun to tell
creation seemed a mighty crack
to make me visible
who occupies this house
a stranger i must judge
since no one knows his circumstance
tis well the name and age
are writ upon the door
or i should fear to pause
where not so much as honest dog
approach encourages
it seems a curious town
some houses very old
some  newly raised this afternoon
were i compelled to build
it should not be among
inhabitants so still
but where the birds assemble
and boys were possible
before myself was born
twas settled so they say
a territory for the ghosts
and squirrels formerly
until a pioneer as
settlers often do
liking the quiet of the place
attracted more unto
and from a settlement
a capital has grown
distinguished for the gravity
of every citizen
the owner of this house
a stranger he must be
eternitys acquaintances
are mostly so  to me
drab habitation of whom
tabernacle or tomb
or dome of worm
or porch of gnome
or some elfs catacomb
of consciousness her awful mate
the soul cannot be rid
as easy the secreting her
behind the eyes of god
the deepest hid is sigh ted first
and scant to him the crowd
hat triple lenses burn upon
the escapade from god
a cloud withdrew from the sky
supenor glory be
but that cloud and its auxiliaries
are forever lost to me
had i but further scanned
had i secured the glow
in an hermetic memory
it had availed me now
never to pass the angel
with a glance and a bow
till i am firm in heaven
is my intention now
of silken speech and specious shoe
a traitor is the bee
his service to the newest grace
present continually
his suit a chance
his troth a term
protracted as the breeze
continual ban propoundeth he
continual divorce
how fortunate the grave
all prizes to obtam
successful certam if at last
first suitor not in vain

how happy i was if i could forget
to remember how sad i am
would be an easy adversity
but the recollecting of bloom
keeps making november difficult
till i who was almost bold
lose my way like a little child
and perish of the cold
herem a blossom lies
a sepulchre between
cross it and overcome the bee
remain  tis but a rind
what did they do since i saw them
were they industrious
so many questions to put them
have i the eagerness
that could i snatch their faces
that could their lips reply
not till the last was answered
should they start for the sky
not if their party were waltmg
not if to talk with me
vere to them now homesickness
after eternrty
not if the just suspect me
and offer a reward
vould i restore my booty
to that bold person god
sweet to have had them lost
for news that they be saved
the nearer they departed us
the nearer they restored
shall stand to our right hand
most precious and the dead
next precious
those that rose to go
then thought of us and stayed
the first day that i was a life
i recollect it how still
that last day that i was a life
i recollect it  as well
twas stiller  though the first
was soll
twas empty but the first
was full
this  was my finallest occasion
but then
my tenderer experiment
toward men
which choose i
that  i cannot say
which choose thev
question memory
i hide myself within my flower
that fading from your vase
you unsuspecting feel for me
almost a loneliness
had i not this or this i said
appealing to myself
in moment of prosperity
inadequate  were life
thou hast not me nor me  it said
in moment of reverse
and yet thou art industrious
no need  hadst thou  of us
my needwas all i hadi sald
the need did not reduce
because the food  exterminate
the hunger  does not cease
but diligence  is sharper
proportioned to the chance
to feed upon the retrograde
enfeebles  the advance
between my countryand the others
there is a sea
but flowers  negotiate between us
as ministry
the admirations  and con tempts  of time
show justest  through an open tomb
the dying  as it were a height
reorganizes estimate
and what we saw not
we distinguish clear
and mostlysee not
what we saw before
tis compound vision
light  enablmg light
the finite  furnished
with the infinite
convexand concave witness
back  toward time
and forward
toward the god of him
till death  is narrow loving
the scantest heart extant
will hold you till your privilege
of finiteness  be spent
but he whose loss procures you
such destitution that
your life too abject for itself
thenceforward imitate
until resemblance perfect
yourself for his pursuit
delight of nature  abdicate
exhibit love  somewhat
tis sunnse  little maid  hast thou
no station in the day
twas not thy wont to hinder so
retrieve thine industry
tis noon  my little maid
alas  and art thou sleeping yet
the lilywaiting to be wed
the bee  hast thou forgot
my little maid  tis night  alas
that night should he to thee
instead of morning  hadst thou broached
thy little plan to dle
dissuade thee if i could not sweet
i might have aided  thee

i make his crescent fill or lack
his nature is at full
or quarter  as i signify
his tides  do i control
he holds superior in the sky
or gropes at my command
behind inferior clouds  or round
a mists slow colonnade
but since we hold a mutual disc
and front a mutual day
which is the despot neither knows
nor whose  the tyranny
experience is the angled road
preferred against the mmd
bv  paradox  the mind itself
pesummg it to lead
qmte opposite  how complicate
the discipline of man
compelling him to choose himself
his preappointed pain
too little way the house must lie
from every human heart
that holds in undisputed lease
a white inhabitant
too narrow is the right between
too imminent the chance
each consciousness must emigrate
and lose its neighbor once
peace is a fiction of our faith
the bells a winter night
beanng the neighbor out of sound
that never did alight
and this of all my hopes
this is the silent end
bountiful colored my morning rose
early and sere its end
never bud from a stem
stepped vlith so gay a foot
never a worm so confident
bored at so brave a root
i cannot be ashamed
because i cannot see
the love you offer
magnitude
reverses modesty
and i cannot be proud
because a height so high
involves alpine
requirements
and services of snow
faith  is the pierless bridge
supporting what we see
unto the scene that we do not
too slender for the eye
it bears the soul as bold
as it were rocked in steel
with arms of steel at either side
it joins  behind the veil
to what could we presume
the bridge would cease to be
to our far vacillating feet
a first necessi
his feet are shod with gauze
his helmet is of gold
his breast a single onyx
with chrysophrase inlaid
his labor is a chant
his idleness  a tune
oh for a bees experience
of clovers and of noon
love  is anterior to life
postenor  to death
initial of creation and
the exponent of earth
only a shrine but mine
i made the taper shine
madonna dim to whom all feet may come
regard a nun
thou knowest every woe
needless to tell theeso
but canst thou do
the grace next to it  heal
that looks a harder skill to us
still just as easy if it he thy will
to theegrant me
thou knowest though so why tell thee
if i can stop one heart from breaking
i shall not live in vain
if i can ease one life the aching
or cool one pain
or help one faintmg robin
unto his nest again
i shall not live in vain
we can but follow to the sun
as oft as he go down
he leave ourselves a sphere behind
tis mostly  following
we go no further with the dust
than to the earthen door
and then the panels are reversed
and we behold  no more
if it had no pencil
would it try mine
worn  now and dull sweet
writing much to thee
if it had no word
would it make the daisy
most as big as i was
when it plucked me
those who have been in the grave the longest
those who begin today
eq uall y perish from our practise
death is the other way
foot of the bold did least attempt it
itis the whlte exploit
once to achieve annuls the power
once to communicate
how the watels closed above him
we shall never know
how he stretched his anguish to us
that  is covered too
spreads the pond her base of lilies
bold above the boy
vhose unclaimed hat and jacket
sum the history
love  is that later thing than death
more previous  than life
confirms it at its entrance  and
usurps itof itself
tastes death  the first  to hand the song
the second  to its friend
disanns the little interval
deposlts him wlth god
then hovers  an inferior guard
lest this beloved charge
needonce in an etemity
a smaller than the large
struck was i not yet by lightning
lightning lets away
power to perceive his process
with vitality
maimed  was i  yet not by venture
stone of stolid boy
nor a sportsmans peradventure
who mine enemy
robbed  was i  intact to bandit
all my mansion torn
sun  withdrawn to recogmtion
furthest shming  done
yet was not the foeof any
not the smallest bird
in the nearest orchard dwelling
be of me  afraid
most  i love the cause that slew me
often as i die
its beloved recognition
holds a sun on me
best at settingas is natures
neither witnessed rise
till the infinite aurora
in the others eyes
patience  has a quiet outer
patience  look within
is ari insects futile forces
infinites  between
scaping one  against the other
fruitlesser to ring
patience  is the snules exertion
through the quivering
absent place  an april day
daffodils ablow
homesick curiosity
to the souls that snow
drift may block within it
deeper than without
daffodil delight but
him it duplicate
the heart has narrow banks
it measures like the sea
in mighty  unremitting bass
and blue monotony
till hurricane bisect
and as itself discerns
its insufficient area
the heart convulsive learns
that calm is but a wall
of unattempted gauze
an instants push demohshes
a questioning  dissolves
how far is it to heaven
as far as death this way
of river or of ridge beyond
was no discovery
how far is it to hell
as far as death this way
how far left hand the sepulchre
defies topography
there is a june when corn is cut
and roses in the seed
a summer briefer than the first
but tenderer indeed
as should a face supposed the graves
emerge a single noon
in the vermilion that it wore
affect us and return
two seasons it is said exjst
the summer of the just
and this of ours diversified
with prospect and with frost
may not our second with its first
so infinite compare
that we but recollect the one
tho other to prefer
noon  is the hinge of day
evening  the tissue door
morning  the east compelling the sill
till all the world is ajar
my best acquaintances are those
with whom i spoke no word
the stars that stated come to town
esteemed e never rude
although to their celestial call
i failed to make reply
my constant reverential face
sufficient courtesy
tvlo travellers perishing in snow
the forests as they froze
together heard them strengthemng
each other with the words
that heaven if heaven  must con tam
vhat either left behind
and then the cheer too solemn grew
for language and the wind
long steps across the features took
that love had touched that mom
with reverential hyacinth
the taleless days went on
till mystery impatient drew
and those they left behind
led absent were procured of heaven
as those first furnished said
that is solemn we have ended
be it but a play
or a glee among the garret
or a holiday
or a leaving home or latet
parting with a world
we have understood for better
still to be explamed
c r                                                       r
death leaves us homesick who behind
except that it is gone
are ignorant of its concern
as if it were not born
through all their fonner places we
like individuals go
who something lost the seeking for
is all thats left them now
this dust and its feature
accredited today
will in a second future
cease to identify
this mind and its measure
a too minute area
for its enlarged inspections
comparison  appear
this world and its species
a too concluded show
for its absorbed attentions
remotest scrutiny
i felt a cleaving in my mind
as if my brain had split
i tried to match it  seam by seam
but could not make them fit
see poem
the thought behind i strove to join
unto the thought before
but sequence ravelled out of sound
like ballsupon a floor
fairer through fadingas the day
into the darkness dips away
half her complexion of the sun
hindering  haunting  perishing
rallies her glow like a dying friend
teasing with glittermg amend
only to aggravate the dark
through an expiring  perfect look
what i see not i better see
through faith  my hazel eye
has periods of shutting
but no lid has memory
for frequent all my sense obscured
i equally behold
as someone held a light unto
the features so beloved
and i arise  and in my dream
do thee distinguished grace
till jealous daylight interrupt
and mar thy perfectness
on that dear frame the years had worn
yet precious as the house
in which we first experienced light
the witnessing to us
precious it was conceiveless fair
as hands the grave had grimed
should softly place within our own
denying that they died
the lady feeds her little bird
at rarer intervals
the little bird would not dissent
but meekly recognize
the gulf between the hand and her
and crumbless and afar
and fainting on her yellow knee
fall softly and adore
snow beneath whose chilly softness
some that never lay
make their first repose this winter
i admonish thee
blanket wealthier the neighbor
we so new bestow
than thine acclimated creature
wilt thou austere snow
a coffin  is a small domain
yet able to contain
a citizen of paradise
in its diminished plane
a grave  is a restricted breadth
yet ampler than the sun
and all the seas he populates
and lands he looks upon
to him who on its small repose
bestows a single friend
circumference without relief
or estimate  or end
i learned  at least  what home could be
how ignorant i had been
of pretty ways of covenant
how awkward at the hymn
round our new fireside  but for this
this pattern  of the way
whose memory drowns me hke the dip
of a celestial sea
what mornings in our garden  guessed
what bees  for us  to hum
with only birds to interrupt
the ripple of our theme
and task for both
when play be done
your problemof the brain
and mine  some foolisher effect
a rufheora tune
the afternoons  together spent
and twilight  in the lanes
some ministry to poorer lives
seen poorest  thro our gains
and then return  and night and home
and then away to you to pass
a new  diviner  care
till sunrise take us back to scene
transmuted vlvider
this seems a home
and home is not
but what that place could be
afhicts me  as a setting sun
where dawn  knows how to be
this is a blossom of the brain
a small italic seed
lodged by design or happening
the spirit fructified
shy as the wmd of his chambers
swift as a freshets tongue
so of the flower of the soul
its process is unknown
when it is found a few rejoice
the wise convey it home
carefully cherishing the spot
if other flower become
when it is lost that day shall be
the funeral of god
upon his breast a closing soul
the flower of our lord
it is an honorable thought
and makes one lift ones hat
as one met sudden gendefolk
upon a daily street
that weve immortal place
though pyramids decay
and kingdoms like the orchard
flit russetly away
of tolling bell i ask the cause
a soul has gone to heaven
im answered in a lonesome tone
is heaven then a prison
that bells should ring till all should know
a soul had gone to heaven
would seem to me the more the way
a good news should be given
twas crisis  all the length had passed
that dull benumbing tlme
there is in fever or event
and now the chance had come
the instant holding in its claw
the pnvilege to live
or warrant to report the soul
the other side the grave
the muscles grappled as wlth leads
that would not let the will
the spirit shook the adamant
but could not make it feel
the second poised  debated  shot
another had begun
and simultaneously a soul
escaped the house unseen
under the light yet under
under the grass and the dirt
under the beetles cellar
under the clovers root
further than ann could stretch
were it giant long
further than sunshine could
were the day year long
over the light yet over
over the arc of the bird
over the comets chimney
over the cubits head
further than guess can gallop
further than riddle ride
oh for a disc to the distance
between ourselves and the dead
the sunset stopped on cottages
there sunset hence must be
for treason not of his but lfes
gonevvesterly today
the sunset stopped on cottages
where morning just begun
what difference after all thou makst
thou supercilious sun
as frost is best conceived
by force of its result
ahliction is inferred
by subsequent effect
if when the sun reveal
the garden keep the gash
if as the days resume
the wilted countenance
cannot correct the crease
or counteract the stain
presumption is vitality
was somewhere put in twain
a man may make a remark
in itself  a quiet thing
that may furnish the fuse unto a spark
in dormant nature lain
let us deport  with skiil
let us discoursewith care
powder exists in charcoal
before it exists in fire

a door just opened on a street
i lost  was passing by
an instants width of warmth disclosed
and wealthand company
the door as instant shut  and i
i lost  was passing by
lost doubly but by contrastmost
infonning misery
the chemical conviction
that nought be lost
enable in disaster
my fractured trust
the faces of the atoms
if i shall see
how more the finished creatures
departed me
the hollows round his eager eyes
were pages where to read
pathenc histories  although
himself had not complained
biography to all who passed
of unobtrusive pain
except for the italic face
endured unhelped unknown
what shall i do when the summer troubles
what when the rose is ripe
what when the eggs by off in music
from the maple keep
what shall i do when the skies a chirrup
drop a tune on me
when the bee hangs all noon in the buttercup
what will become of me
oh when the squirrells his pockets
and the berries stare
how can i bear their jocund faces
thou from here so far
twouldnt afbict a robin
all his goods have wings
i  do not fly so vherefore
my perennial things
as one does sickness over
in convalescent mind
his scrutmy of chances
by blessed health obscured
as one rewalks a precipice
and whittles at the twig
that held him from perdition
sown sidewise in the crag
a custom of the soul
far after suffering
identity to question
for evidence t has been
we met as sparksdiverging flints
sent vanous  scattered ways
we parted as the central flmt
were cloven with an adze
subsisting on the light we bore
before we felt the dark
a flint unto this dayperhaps
but for that single spark
a loss of something ever felt i
the first that i could recollect
bereft i wasof what i knew not
too young that any should suspect
a mourner walked among the children
i notwithstanding went about
as one bemoaning a dommion
itself the only prince cast out
elder today a session wiser
and fainter too as wiseness is
i find myself still softly searching
for my delinquent palaces
and a suspicion like a finger
touches my forehead now and then
that i am looking oppositely
for the site of the kingdom of heaven
as plan for noon and plan for night
so differ life and death
in positive prospective
the foot upon the earth
at distance and achievement strains
the foot upon the grave
makes effort at conclusion
assisted faint of love
wert thou but ill that i might show thee
how long a day i could endure
though thine attention stop not on me
nor the least signal me assure
wert thou but stranger in ungracious country
and mme  the door
thou paused at for a passing bounty
no more
accused  wert thou  and myself  t nbunal
convicted  sentenced  ermme  not to me
half the condition thy reverse  to follow
just topartakethe infamy
the tenant of the narrow cottage wert thou
permit to be
the housewife in thy low attendance
contenteth me
no service hast thou i would not achieve it
to dieor hve
the first  sweet proved i ere i saw thee
for life  be love
midsummer was it when they died
a full and perfect time
the summer closed upon itself
in consummated bloom
the com her furthest kernel filled
before the coming flail
when these leaned into perfectness
through haze of burial
a nearness to tremendousness
an agony procures
afbictlon ranges boundlessness
vicinity to laws
contentments quiet suburb
affiictlon cannot stay
in acres  its location
is illocality
unto me i do not know you
where may be your house

this is far from thence
arms of mme  sufficient phaeton
trust omnipotence
am spotted  i am pardon
i am small the least
is esteemed m heaven the chiefest
occupy my house
denial is the only fact
perceived by the denied
whose wilia numb significance
the day the heaven died
and all the earth strove common round
without delight or beam
what comfort was it wisdom  was
the spoiler of our home
all forgot for recollecting
just a paltry one
all forsook for just a strangers
new accompanying
grace of wealth and grace of station
less accounted than
an unkown esteem possessing
estimate  who can
home effaced  her faces dwindled
nature  altered small

dropped  my fate  a timid peb hle
in thy bolder sea
prove  me  sweet  if i regret it
prove myself  of thee
pain  expands the time
ages coil withm
the minute circumference
of a single brain
pain contracts  the t lffie
occupied with shot
gamuts of eternities
are as they were not
fitter to see him i may be
for the long hindrance  grace  to me
with summers and with winters grow
some passing year  a trait bestow
to make me fairest of the earth
the waiting  then  will seem so worth
i shall impute with half a pain
the blame that i was chosen  then
time to anticipate his gaze
its firstdelightand thensurprise
the turning oer and oer my face
for evidence it be the grace
he left behind one day  so less
he seek conviction that be this
i only must not grow so new
that hell mistake  and ask for me
of mewhen first unto the door
i go  to elsewhere go no more
i only must not change so fair
hell sigh  the other  she is where
the love tho will array me right
i shall be perfect  in his sight
if he perceive the other truth
upon an excellenter youth
how sweet i shall not lack in vam
but gain  thro loss  through grief  obtain
the beauty that reward him best
the beauty of demandat rest
he who in himself believes
fraud cannot presume
faith is constancys result
and assumes  from home
cannot perish though it fail
every second time
but defaced vicariously
for some other shame
color  caste  denomination
these  are times affair
deaths diviner classifymg
does not know they are
as  sleepall hue forgotten
tenetsput behind
deaths large  democratic fingers
rub away the brand
if circasslan  he is careless
if he put away
chrysalis of blonde  or umber
equal butterhy
they emerge from his obscuring
what death  knows so well
our minuter intultions
deem unplausible
robbed by death  but that was easy
to the failing eye
i could hold the latest glowog
robbed by liberty
for her jugular defences
this too i endured
hint of gloryit afforded
for the brave beloved
fraud of distance  fraud of danger
fraud of death  to bear
it is bounty  to suspenses
vague calamity
staking our entire possession
on a hairs result
then  seesawing  coolly  on it
trying if it split
unfulfilled to observation
incompleteto eye
but to faith  a revolution
in locality
unto us  the suns extinguish
to our opposite
new horizons  they embelllsh
fronting us  wlth nlght
twas awkward but it fitted me
an anclent fashioned heart
its only lore  its steadfastness
in change  unerudite
it only moved as do the suns
for merit of return
or birds  confirmed perpetual
by alternating zone
i only have it not tonight
in its established place
for technicality of death
omitted in the lease
the souls distinct connection
with immortality
is best disclosed by danger
or quick calamity
as lightning on a landscape
exhibits sheets of place
not yet suspected  but for flash
and click  and suddenness
the mountam sat upon the plain
in his tremendous chair
his observation omnifold
his inquest everywhere
the seasons played around his knees
like children round a sire
grandfather of the days is he
of dawn the ancestor
death is a dialogue between
the spirit and the dust
dissolve says death  the spirit sir
i have another trust
death doubts it  argues from the ground
the spirit turns away
just laying off for evidence
an overcoat of clay
besides this may
we know
there is another
how fair
our speculations of the foreigner
some know him whom we knew
sweet wonder
a nature be
where saints and our plain going neighbor
keep may
it bloomed and dropt a single noon
the flower  distinct and red
i passing thought another noon
another in its stead
will equal glow and thought no more
but came another day
to find the species disappeared
the same locality
the sun in place  no other fraud
on natures perfect sum
had i but lingered yesterday
was my retrieveless blame
much flowers of this and further zones
have perished in my hands
for seeking its resemblance
bu t unapproached it stands
the single flower of the earth
that i in passing by
unconscious wasgreat natures face
passed infinite by me
this merit hath the worst
it cannot be again
when fate hath taunted last
and thrown her furthest stone
the maimed may pause and breathe
and glance securely round
the deer attracts no further
than it resists  the hound
purple  is fashionable twlce
tills season of the year
and when a soul perceives itself
to be an emperor
as sleigh bells seem in summer
or bees at chnstmas show
so fairy  so fictitlous
the individuals do
repealed from observation
a party that we knew
more distant in an instant
than dawn in timbuctoo
no other can reduce
our mortal consequence
like the remembering it be nought
a period from hence
but contemplation for
contemporaneous nought
our single competition
jehovahs estimate
ideals are the fairy oil
with which we help the wheel
but when the vital axle turns
the eye rejects the
tis anguish grander than delight
tis resurrection pain
the meetmg bands of smitten face
we questioned to again
tis transport wild as thrills the graves
when cerements let go
and creatures clad in miracle
go up by two and two
the missing all prevented me
from missing minor things
if nothing larger than a worlds
departure from a hinge
or suns extinction be observed
twas not so large that i
could lift my forehead from my work
for curiosity

a narrow fellow in the grass
occasionally rides
you may have met him  did you not
his notice sudden is
the grass divides as with a comb
a spotted shaft is seen
and then it closes at your feet
and opens further on
he likes a boggy acre
a floor too cool for corn
yet when a boy and barefoot
i more than once at noon
have passed i thought a whip lash
unbraiding in the sun
when stooping to secure it
it wrinkled and was gone
several of natures people
i know and they know me
i feel for them a transport
of cordiality
but never met this fellow
attended or alone
without a tighter breathmg
and zero at the bone
the leaves like women interchange
exclusive confidence
somewhat of nods and somewhat
portentous inference
the parties  both cases
enjoining secrecy
inviolable compact
to notoriety
the definition of beauty is
that definition is none
of heaven easing analysis
since heaven and he are one
gratitude  is not the mention
of a tenderness
but lts still appreciation
out of plumb of speech
when the sea return no answer
by the line and lead
proves it theres no sea or rather
a remoter bed
not all die early dying young
maturity of fate
is consummated equally
in ages or a night
a hoary boy ive known to drop
whole statured  by the side
of junior of fourscore twas act
not period  that died
she sped as petals of a rose
offended by the wmd
a frail aristocrat of time
indemnity to find
leaving on nature  a default
as cricket or as bee
but andes in the bosoms where
she had begun to lie
the dust behmd i strove to join
unto the disk before
but sequence ravelled out of sound
like balls upon a floor

the absence of an eye
except its mind accompany
abridge society

inciude us  as they go

abstemiously
the rose is an estate
in sicily
this was in the white of the year
that  was in the green
drifts were as difficult then to think
as daisies now to be seen
lookmg back is best that is left
or if it be  before
see poem
retrospection is prospects half
sometimes almost more
well pass without the parting
so to spare
certificate of absence
deeming where
i left her i could find her
if i tried
this way i keep from missing
those that died
crumbling is not an instants act
a fundamental pause
dilapidation is processes
are organized decays
tis first a cobweb on the soul
a cuticle of dust
a borer in the axis
an elemental rust
rum is formal devils work
consecutive and slow
fail in an instant no man did
slippingis crashs law
best things dwell out of sight
the pearl the just  our thought
most shun the public air
legitimate and rare
the capsule of the wind
the capsule of the mind
exhibit here as doth a burr
germs germ be where
superfluous were the sun
when excellence be dead
he were superfluous every day
for every day be said
that syllable whose faith
just saves it from despair
and whose ill meet you hesitates
if love inquire where
upon his dateless fame
our periods may lie
as stars that drop anonymous
from an abundant sky
the fingers of the light
tapped soft upon the town
with i am great and cannot wait
so therefore let me in
youre soon the town replied
my faces are asieep
but swear and i williet you by
you will not wake them up
the easy guest complied
but once within the town

the transport of his countenance
awakened maid and man
the neighbor in the pool
upon his hip elate
made loud obeisance and the gnat
held up his cup for light
the stimulus beyond the grave
his countenance to see
supports me like imperial drams
afforded day by day
aurora is the effort
of the celestial face
unconsciousness of perfectness
to simulate to us
dying at my music
bubble bubble
hold me till the octaves runl
quick burst the windows
ritardandol
phials left and the sun
there is no silence in the earth  so silent
as that endured
tvhich uttered would discourage nature
and haunt the world
bind me  i still can sing
banish  my mandolin
strikes true within
slay  and my soul shall rise
chanting to paradise
still thine
the first we knew of him was death
the second  was  renown
except the first had justified
the second had not been
falsehood of thee could i suppose
twould undermine the sill
to which my faith pmned block by block
her cedar citadel
how still the bells in steeples stand
till swollen with the sky
they leap upon their silver feet
in frantic melody
i was a phoebe  nothmg more
a phoebe  nothing less
the little note that others dropt
i fi tted mto place
i dwelt too low that any seek
too shy that any blame
a phoebe makes a little prmt
upon the floors of fame
up lifes hill with my little bundle
if i prove it steep
if a discouragement withhold me
if my newest step
older feel than the hope that prompted
spotless be from blame
heart that proposed as heart that accepted
homelessness for home
she rose as high as his occasion
then sought the dust
and lower lay in low westminster
for her brief crest
which is best heaven
or only heaven to come
with that old codicil of doubt
i cannot help esteem
the blrd within the hand
supenor to the one
the bush may yield me
or may not
too late to choose again
too scanty twas to die for you
the merest greek could that
the living sweet is costlier
i offer even that
the dymg is a trifle past
but living this include
the dymg multifold  without
the respite to be dead
old we abolish frost
the summer would not cease
if seasons perish or prevail
is optional with us
were it but me that gained the height
were it but they that failed
how many things the dying play
might they but live they would
the hills in purple syllables
the days adventures tell
to little groups of conbnents
just gomg home from school
to die  wi thou t the dying
and live  without the life
this is the hardest miracle
propounded to belief
who saw no sunrise cannot say
the countenance twould be
who guess at seeing guess at loss
of the ability
the emigrant of light it is
afhicted for the day
the blindness that beheld and blest
and could not find its eye
my seasons furthest flower
i tenderer commend
because i found her kmsmanless
a grace without a friend
trudging to eden looking backward
i met somebodys little boy
asked him his name  he lisped me trotwood
lady did he belong to thee
would it comfort  to know i met him
and that he didnt look afraid
i couldnt weep  for so many smiling
new acquaintance  this baby made

far from love the heavenly father
leads the chosen child
oftener through realm of briar
than the meadow mild
oftener by the claw of dragon
than the hand of friend
guides the little one predestmed
to the native land
i knew that i had gained
and yet i knew not how
by dmunution it was not
but discipline unto
a rigor unrelieved
except by the content
another bear its duplicate
in other continent
it rises  passes  on our south
inscribes a simple noon
cajoles a moment with the spires
and infinite is gone
so large my will
the little that i may
embarrasses
like gentle infamy
affront to him
for whom the whole were small
affront to me
who know his meed of all
earth at the best
is but a scanty toy
bought carried home
to immortality
it looks so small
we chiefly wonder then
at our conceit
in purchasmg

the dying need hut little dear
a glass of waters all
a flowers unobtrusive face
to punctuate the wall
a fan perhaps a friends regret
and certainty that one
no color in the rainbow
perceive when you are gone
my heart upon a little plate
her palate to delight
a berry or a bun would be
might it an apricot
twas my one glory
let it be
remembered
i was owned of thee
nor mountain hinder me
nor sea
whos baltlc
whos cordillera
that such have died enable us
the tranquiller to die
that such have lived
certificate for immortality
fate slew him but he did not drop
she felled  he did not fall
impaled him on her fiercest stakes
he neutralized them all
she stung him  sapped his firm advance
but when her worst was done
and he  unmoved regarded her
acknowledged him a man
who is the east
the yellow man
who may be purple if he can
that carries in the sun
who is the west
the purple man
who may be yellow if he can
that lets him out again
said death to passion
give of thine an acre unto me
said passion through contracting breaths
a thousand times thee nay
bore death from passion
all his east
he  sovereign as the sun
resituated in the west
and the debate was done
his bill an auger is
his head a cap and frill
he laboreth at every tree
a vorm his utmost goal
bee im expecting you l
was saying yesterday
to somebody you know
that you were due
the frogs got home last week
are settled and at work
birds mostly back
the clover warm and thick
youll get my letter by
the seventeenth reply
or better be with me
yours fly
satisfaction  is the agent
of satiety
wanta quiet commissary
for infinity
to possess is past the instant
we achieve the joy
immortality contented
were anomaly
here where the daisies fit my head
tis easiest to he
and every grass that plays outside
is sorry some for me
where i am not afraid to go
i may confide my flower
who was not enemy of me
will gentle be to her
nor separate herself and me
by distances become
a single bloom we constitute
departed or at home
her httle parasol to lift
and once to let it down
her whole responsibility
to imitate be mine
a summer further i must wear
content if natures drawer
presen t me from sepulchral crease
as blemishless as her
i heard as if i had no ear
until a vital word
came all the way from life to me
and then i knew i heard
i saw as if my eye were on
another till a thing
and now i know twas light because
it fitted them came in
i dwelt as if myself were out
my body but within
until a might detected me
and set my kernel in
and spmt turned unto the dust
old friend thou knowest me
and tune went out to tell the news
and met eternity
not so the infinite relations  below
division is adhesions forfeit  on high
afhiction but a speculation  and woe
a fallacy a figment we knew
somewhat to hope for
be it neer so far
is capital against desparr
somewhat to suffer
be it neer so keen
if terminable may be borne
spring comes on the world
i sight the aprxis
hueless to me until thou come
as till the bee
blossoms stand negative
touched to conditions
by a hum
lest this be heaven mdeed
an obstacle is given
that always gauges a degree
between ourself and heaven
a sickness of this world it most occasions
when best men die
a wishfulness their far condition
to occupy
a chief indifference as foreign
a wodd must be
themselves forsake  contented
for deity
nature rarer uses yellow
than another hue
saves she all of that for sunsets
prodigal of blue
spending scarlet like a woman
yellow she affords
only scantly and selectly
like a lovers words
ive dropped my brain  my soul is numb
the veins that used to run
stop palsied  tis paralysis
done perfecter on stone
vitality is carved and cool
my nerve in marble lies
a breathing toman
yesterday  endowed with paradise
not dumb i had a sort that moved
a sense that smote and stirred
instincts for dance  a caper part
an aptitude for bird
who wrought carrara in me
and chiselled all my tune
were it a witchcraftwere it death
ive still a chance to strain
to being somewhere  motion  breath
though centuries beyond
and every limit a decade
ill shiver satisfied
the opening and the close
of being are alike
or differ if they do
as bloom upon a stalk
that from an equal seed
unto an equal bud
go parallel perfected
in that they have decayed
reportless subjects to the quick
continual addressed
but foreign as the dialect
of danes unto the rest
reportless measures to the ear
susceptlve  stimulus
but like an oriental tale
to others fabulous
pain has but one acquaintance
and that is death
each one unto the other
society enough
pam is the junior party
by just a seconds nght
death tenderly assists him
and then absconds from sight
as willing lid oer weary eye
the evening on the day leans
till of all our natures house
remains but balcony
i cannot meet the spring unmoved
i feel the old desire
a hurry with a lingering mixed
a warrant to be fair
a competition in my sense
with something hid in her
and as she vanishes remorse
i saw no more of her
i never saw a moor
i never saw the sea
yet know i how the heather looks
and what a billow be
i never spoke with god
nor visited in heaven
yet certain am i of the spot
as if the checks were given
it was a quiet way
he asked if i was his
i made no answer of the tongue
but answer of the eyes
and then he bore me on
before this mortal noise
with swiftness as of chariots
and distance as of wheels
this world did drop away
as acres from the feet
of one that leaneth from balloon
upon an ether street
the gulf behind was not
the continents were new
eternity it was before
eternity was due
no seasons were to us
it was not night nor morn
but sunrise stopped upon the place
and fastened it in dawn
not to discover weakness is
the artifice of strength
impregnability mheres
as much through consciousness
of faith of others m itself
as pyramidal nerve
behind the most unconscious clock
what skilful pointers move
the soul should always stand ajar
that if the heaven inquire
he will not be obhged to wait
or shy of troubling her
depart before the host have slid
the bolt unto the door
to search for the accomplished guest
her visitor no more
there is a zone whose even years
no solstice interrupt
whose sun constructs perpetual noon
whose perfect seasons wait
whose summer set in summer till
the centuries of june
and centuries of august cease
and consciousness  is noon
i had a daily bliss
i half indlfferent viewed
till sudden i perceived it stir
it grew as i pursued
till when around a helght
it wasted from my slght
increased beyond my utmost scope
i learned to estimate
bloom  is result  to meet a flower
and casually glance
would scarcely cause one to suspect
the mmor circumstance
assisting in the bright affair
so mtricately done
then offered as a butterfly
to the meridlan
to pack the bud  oppose the worm
obtain its right of dew
adjust the heatelude the wmd
escape the prowling bee
great nature not to disappoint
awaiting her that day
to be a flower is profound
responsibility
sang from the heart sire
dipped my beak in it
if the tune drip too much
have a tint too red
pardon the cochineal
suffer the venmlion
death is the wealth
of the poorest bird
bear with the ballad
awkward  faltenng
death twists the strings
twasnt my blame
pause in your llturgies
wait your chorals
while i repeat your
hallowed name
air has no residence no neighbor
no ear no door
no apprehension of another
oh happy air
ethereal guest at een an outcasts pillow
essential host in lifes faint wailmg inn
later than light thy consciousness accost me
till it depart persuading mine
three weeks passed since i had seen her
some disease had vext
twas with text and village smging
i beheld her next
and a company  our pleasure
to discourse alone
gracious now to me as any
gracious unto none
borne without dissent of either
to the pansh mght
of the separated parties
which be out of sight
he scanned it  staggered
dropped the loop
to past or period
caught helpless at a sense as if
his mind were going blind
groped up to see if god was there
groped backward at himself
caressed a trigger absently
and wandered out of life
ashes denote that fire was
revere the grayest pile
for the departed creatures sake
that hovered there awhile
ere exists the first in light
and then consolidates
only the chemist can disclose
into what carbonates
to help our bleaker parts
salubrious hours are given
which if they do not fit for earth
drill silently for heaven
let down the bars oh death
the tired flocks come in
whose bleating ceases to repeat
whose wandering is done
thine is the stillest mght
thine the securest fold
too near thou art for seekmg thee
too tender to be told
fames boys and girls who never die
and are too seldom born
except the smaller size
no lives are round
these  hurry to a sphere
and show and end
the larger  slower grow
and later hang
the summers of hesperides
are long
further in summer than the birds
pathetic from the grass
a minor nation celebrates
its unobtrusive mass
no ordinance be seen
so gradual the grace
a pensive custom it becomes
enlarging loneliness
antiquest felt at noon
when august burning low
arise this spectral canticle
repose to typify
remit as yet no grace
no furrow on the glow
yet a druidic difference
enhances nature now
paradise is of the option
whosoever will
own in eden notwithstanding
adam and repeal
to undertake is to achieve
be undertaking blent
with fortitude of obstacle
and toward encouragement
that fine suspiclon t natures must
pennitted to revere
departed standards and the few
criterion sources here
perception of an object costs
precise the objecfs loss
perception in itself a gain
replying to its price
the object absolute is nought
perception sets it fair
and then upbraids a perfectness
that situates so far
title divine  is mine
the wifewithout the sign
acute degree  conferred on me
empress of calvary
royalall but the crown
betrothedwithout the swoon
god sends us women
when you  hold  garnet to garnet
gold  to gold
born  bridalled  shrouded
in a day
tri victory
my husbandwomen say
strokmg the melody
is this  the way
experiment to me
is every one i meet
if it contain a kernel
the figure of a nut
presents upon a tree
equally plausibly
but meat within is requisite
to squirrels and to me
count not that far that can be had
though sunset lie between
nor that adjacent that beside
is further than the sun
the sky is low  the clouds are mean
a travelling flake of snow
across a barn or through a rut
debates if it will go
a narrow wind complains all day
how some one treated him
nature hke us is sometimes caught
without her diadem
just once oh least request
could adamant refuse
so small a grace
so scanty put
such agonizing terms
would not a god of flmt
be conscious of a sigh
as down his heaven dropt remote
just once sweet deity
these are the signs to natures inns
her invitation broad
to whosoever famishing
to taste her mystic bread
these are the rites of natures house
the hospltality
that opens with an equal width
to beggar and to bee
for sureties of her staunch estate
her un decaying cheer
the purple in the east is set
and in the north the star
the bustle in a house
the morning after death
is solemnest of industnes
enacted upon earth
the sweepmg up the heart
and puttmg love away
we shall not want to use again
until eternity
the sun went down  no man looked on
the earth and i alone
were present at the majesty
he triumphed and went on
the sun went up  no man looked on
the earth and i and one
a nameless bird  a stranger
were witness for the crown
when they come back  if blossoms do
i always feel a doubt
if blossoms can be born again
when once the art is out
when they begin if robins may
i alwavs had a fear
i did ot tell it was their last expenment
last year
when it is may if may return
had nobody a pang
lest in a face so beautiful
he might not look again
if i am there  one does not know
what partyone may be
tomorrow but if i am there
i take back all i say
superiority to fate
is difficult to gain
tis not conferred of any
but possible to earn
a pittance at a time
until to her surprise
the soul with strict economy
subsist till paradise
revolution is the pod
systems rattle from
when the winds of will are stirred
excellent is bloom
but except its russet base
every summer be
the entomber of itself
so of llberty
left inactive on the stalk
all its purple fled
revolution shakes it for
test if it be dead
we learn in the retreatmg
how vast an one
was recently among us
a perished sun
endear in the departure
how doubly more
than all the golden presence
it was  before
at half past three a smgle bird
unto a silent sky
propounded but a single term
of cautious melody
at half past four experiment
had subjugated test
and  her silver principle
supplanted all the rest
at half past seven element
nor implement be seen
and place was where the presence was
circumference between
if nature smiles  the mother must
im sure at many a whim
of her eccentric family
is she so much to blame
what twigs we held by
oh tbeview
when lifes swift river striven through
we pause before a further plunge
to take momentum
as the fringe
upon a former garment shows
the garment cast
our props disclose
so scant so eminently small
of might to help so pitiful
to sink if we had labored fond
the diligence were not more blmd
how scant by everlasting light
the discs that satisfied our sight
how dimmer than a saturns bar
the things esteemed for thmgs that are
we miss a kinsman more
when warranted to see
than when withheld of oceans
from possibility
a furlong than a league
inflicts a pricklier pain
till we who smiled at pyrenees
of parishes complam
ended ere it begun
the title was scarcely told
when the preface penshed from consciousness
the story unrevealed
had it been mme to print
had it been yours to read
that it was not our privilege
the interdict of god
myself can read the telegrams
a letter chief to me
the stocks advance and retrograde
and what the markets say
the weatherhow the rains
in countles have begun
tis news as null as nothing
but sweeter so  than none
i am afraid to own a body
i am afraid to own a soul
profound  precarious property
possession not optional
double estate  entailed at pleasure
upon an unsuspecting hejr
duke m a moment of deathlessness
and god for a frontier
the well upon the brook
were foolish to depend
let brooks  renew of brooks
but wellsof fauless ground
it was not saint it was too large
nor snowit was too small
it only held itself aloof
like somethmg spiritual
because twas riches i could own
myself had earned it  me
i knew the dollars by their names
it feels like poverty
an earldom out of sight to hold
an income in the air
possession  has a sweeter chmk
unto a misers ear
themself are all i have
myself a freckled  be
i thought youd choose a velvet cheek
or one of ivory
would you  instead of me l
to whom the mornings stand for nights
what must the midnights  be
these strangers in a foreign world
protection asked of me
befriend them lest yourself in heaven
be found a refugee
dew  is the freshet in the grass
tis many a tiny mill
turns unperceived beneath our feet
and artisan lies still
we spy the forests and the hills
the tents to natures show
mistake the outside for the in
and mention what we saw
could commentators on the sign
of natures caravan
obtain admission as a child
some wednesday afternoon
of the heart that goes in and closes the door
shall the playfellow heart complain
though the rmg is unwhole and the company broke
can never be fitted again
my cocoon tightens  colors tease
im feeling for the air
a dim capacity for wings
demeans the dress i wear
a power of butterfly must be
the aptitude to fly
meadows of majesty implies
and easy sweeps of sky
so i must baffie at the hint
and cipher at the sign
and make much blunder if at last
i take the clue divine

the last night that she lived
it was a common night
except the dying  this to us
made nature different
we noticed smallest things
things overlooked before
by this great light upon our minds
italicizedastwere
as we went out and in
between her final room
and rooms where those to be alive
tomorrow were a blame
that others could exist
while she must finish quite
a jealousy for her arose
so nearly infinite
we waited while she passed
it was a narrow time
too jostled were our souls to speak
at length the notice came
she mentioned and forgot
then lightly as a reed
bent to the water struggled scarce
consented and was dead
and we  we placed the hair
and drew the head erect
and then an awful leisure was
belief to regulate
between the form of life and life
the difference is as big
as liquor at the lip between
and liquor in the jug
the latterexcellent to keep
but for ecstatic need
the corkless is superior
i know for i have tried
his bill is clasped  his eye forsook
his feathers wilted low
the claws that clung like lifeless gloves
indifferent hanging now
the joy that in his happy throat
was waiting to be poured
gored through and through with death to be
assassin of a bird
resembles to my outraged mmd
the firing in heaven
on angels  squandering for you
their miracles of tune
the spry arms of the wind
if i could crawl between
i have an errand imminent
to an adjoining zone
i should not care to stop
my process is not long
the wind could walt without the gate
or stroll the town among
to ascertain the house
andis the soul at home
and hold the wick of mine to it
to light and then return
the crickets sang
and set the sun
and workmen finished one by one
their seam the day upon
the low grass loaded with the dew
the twilight stood as strangers do
with hat in hand polite and new
to stay as if or go
a vastness as a neighbor came
a wisdom without face or name
a peace as hemispheres at home
and so the night became
like men and women shadows walk
upon the hills today
with here and there a mighty bow
or trailmg courtesy
to neighbors doubtless of their own
not quickened to perceive
mmuter landscape as ourselves
and boroughs where we live
we do not know the orne we lose
the awful moment is
and takes its fundamental place
among the certainties
a firm appearance still mflates
the card  the chance  the friend
the spectre of solidities
whose substances are sand
the bird did prance  the bee did play
the sun ran miles away
so blind with joy he could not choose
between his holiday
the morn was up the meadows out
the fences all but ran
republic of delight i thought
where each is citizen
from heavy laden lands to thee
were seas to cross to come
a caspian were crowded
too near thou art for fame
ilos
a diamond on the hand
to custom common grown
subsides from its significance
the gem were best unknown
within a sellers shrine
how many sight and sigh
and cannot but are mad for fear
that any other buy
i fit for them
i seek the dark
till i am thorough fit
the labor is a sober one
with this sufficient sweet
that abstinence of mine produce
a purer food for them if i succeed
if not i had
the transport of the aim
none who saw it ever told it
tis as hid as death
had for that specific treasure
a departing breath
surfaces may be invested
did the diamond grow
general as the dandelion
would you serve it so
iii i
some wretched creature savior take
who would exult to die
and leave for thy sweet mercys sake
another hour to me
that this should feel the need of death
the same as those that lived
is such a feat of irony
as never was  achieved
not satisfied to ape the great
in his simplicity
the small must die as well as he
oh the audacity
iij
there is a strength in provmg that it can be borne
although it tear
what are the sinews of such cordage for
except to bear
the ship might be of satin had it not to fight
to walk on seas requires cedar feet

the largest fire ever known
occurs each afternoon
discovered is without surprise
proceeds without concern
consumes and no report to men
an occidental town
rebuilt another morning
to be burned down again
the murmuring of bees has ceased
but murmuring of some
postenor prophetic
has simultaneous come
the lower metres of the year
when natures laugh is done
the revelations of the book
whose genesis was june
appropriate creatures to her change
the typic mother sends
as accent fades to mterval
with separating fnends
till what we speculate has been
and thoughts we will not show
more mtimate with us become
than persons that we know
there is another loneliness
that many die without
not want of friend occasions it
or circumstance of lot
but nature sometimes sometimes thought
and whoso it befall
is ncher than could be revealed
by mortal numeral
a mine there is no man would own
but must it be conferred
demeaning by exclusive wealth
a universe beside
potosi never to be spent
but hoarded in the mind
what misers wring their hands tonight
for indies in the ground

exhilaration is the breeze
that lifts us from the ground
and leaves us in another place
whose statement is not found
returns us not but after time
we soberly descend
a little newer for the term
upon enchanted ground
paradise is that old mansion
many owned before
occupied by each an instant
then reversed the door
bliss is frugal of her leases
adam taught her thrift
bankrupt once through his excesses
unpnished
this slow day moved along
i heard its axles go
as if they could not hoist themselves
they hated motion so
i told my soul to come
it was no use to wait
we went and played and came again
and it was out of sight
time does go on
i tell it gay to those who suffer now
they shall survive
there  a sun
they dont believe it now
tis my first night beneath the sun
if i should spend it here
above him is too low a height
for his barometer
who airs of expectation breathes
and takes the wind at prime
but distance h delights confides
to those who visit him
a great hope fell
you heard no noise
the ruin was within
oh cunning wreck that told no tale
and let no witness in
the mind was built for mighty freight
for dread occasion planned
how often foundering at sea
ostensibly on land
a not admitting of the wound
until it grew so wide
that all my life had entered it
and there were troughs beside
a closmg of the simple lid
that opened to the sun
until the tender carpenter
perpetual nail it down
had we known the ton she bore
we had helped the terror
but she straighter walked for freight
so be hers the error
oh sumptuous moment
slower go
that i may gloat on thee
twill never be the same to starve
now i abundance see
which was to famish then or now
the difference of day
ask him unto the gallows led
with morning in the sky
shall i take thee the poet said
to the propounded word
be stationed with the candidates
till i have finer tried
the poet searched philology
and when about to ring
for the suspended candidate
there came unsummoned in
that portion of the vision
the world applied to fill
not unto nomination
the cherubim reveal
soft as the massacre of suns
by evenings sabres slam
these are the nights that beetles love
from emmence remote
drives ponderous perpendicular
his figure intimate
the terror of the children
the merriment of men
depositing his thunder
he hoists abroad again
a bomb upon the ceiling
is an improving thmg
it keeps the nerves progressive
conjecture flourishing
too dear the summer evening
without discreet alarm
supplied by entomology
with its remaining charm
tell all the truth but tell it slant
success in circuit lies
too bright for our infirm delight
the truths superb surprise
as llghtmng to the children eased
with explanation kind
the truth must dazzle gradually
or every man be blmd
that odd old man is dead a year
we miss his stated hat
twas such an evening bright and stiff
his faded lamp went out
who miss his antiquated wlck
are any hoar for him
waits any indurated mate
his wrinkled coming home
oh life begun in fluent blood
and consummated dull
achievement contemplatmg thee
feels transitive and cool
the merchant of the picturesque
a counter has and sales
but is within or negative
precisely as the calls
to children he is small in pnce
and large in courtesy
it suits him better than a check
their artless currency
of counterfeits he is so shy
do one advance so near
as to behold his ample flight
unfinished
the smouldering embers blush
oh hearts within the coal
hast thou survived so many years
the smouldering embers smile
soft stirs the news of light
the stolid seconds glow
one requisite has fire that lasts
prometheus never knew
unfimshed
the snow that never drifts
the transient fragrant snow
that comes a single time a year
is softly driving now
so thorough in the tree
at night beneath the star
that it was februarys foot
experience would swear
like winter as a face
we stern and former knew
repaired of all but loneliness
by natures alibi
were every stonn so spice
the value could not be
we buy with contrast  pang is good
as near as memory
the wind took up the northern things
and piled them in the south
then gave the east unto the west
and opening his mouth
the four divisions of the earth
did make as to devour
while everything to corners slunk
behmd the awful power
the wind unto his chambers went
and nature ventured out
her subjects scattered into place
her systems ranged about
again the smoke from dwellings rose
the day abroad was heard
how intimate at empest past
the transport of the bird
too cold is this
to warm with sun
too stiff to bended be
to joint this agate were a work
outstaring masonry
how went the agile kernel out
contusion of the husk
nor rip nor wrinkle indicate
but just an asterisk
the frost of death was on the pane
secure your flower said he
like sailors fighting with a leak
we fought mortality
our passive flower we held to sea
to mountain to the sun
yet even on his scarlet shelf
to crawl the frost begun
we pned him back
ourselves we wedged
himself and her between
yet easy as the narrow snake
he forked his way along
till all her helpless beauty bent
and then our wrath begun
we hunted him to his ravine
we chased him to his den
we hated death and hated life
and nowhere was to go
than sea and continent there is
a largerit is woe
the duties of the wind are few
to cast the ships at sea
establish march the floods escort
and usher liberty
the pleasures of the wind are broad
to dwell extent among
remain or wander
speculate or forests entertam
the kinsmen of the wind are peaks
azofthe equinox
also with bird and asteroid
a bowing mtercourse

too wise he seems for wakelessness

a spider sewed at night
without a light
upon an arc of whlte
if ruff it was of dame
or shroud of gnome
himself himself inform
of immortality
his strategy
was physiognomy
her sovereign people
nature knows as well
and is as fond of sigmfying
as if fallible
the day grew small surrounded tight
by early stooping night
the afternoon in evening deep
its yellow shortness dropt
the winds went out their martial ways
the leaves obtained excuse
november hung his granite hat
upon a nail of plush
the face we choose to miss
be it but for a day
as absent as a hundred years
when it has rode away
the props assist the house
until the house is built
and then the props withdraw
and adequate erect
the house support itself
and cease to recollect
the auger and the carpenter
just such a retrospect
hath the perfected life
a past of plank and nail
and slowness  then the scaffolds drop
affirming it a soul
the work of her that went
the toil of fellows done
in ovens green our mother bakes
by fires of the sun
ourselves we do inter with sweet derision
the channel of the dust who once achieves
invalidates the balm of that religion
that doubts as fervently as it believes
in thy long paradise of light
no moment will there be
when i shall long for earthly play
and mortal company
when etna basks and purrs
naples is more afraid
than when she shows her garnet tooth
security is loud
after a hundred years
nobody knows the place
agony that enacted there
motionless as peace
weeds triumphant ranged
strangers strolled and spelled
at the lone orthography
of the elder dead
winds of summer fields
recollect the way
instinct picking up the key
dropped by memory
mter the sun comes out
how it alters the world
waggons like messengers hurry about
yesterday is old
all men meet as if
each foreclosed a news
fresh as a cargo from batize

i noticed people disappeared
when but a httle child
supposed they visited remote
or settled regions wild
now know i  they both visited
and settled regions wild
but did because they died
a fact withheld the little child
unfonished
how many schemes may die
in one short afternoon
entirely unknown
to those they most concern
the man that was not lost
because by accident
he varied by a ribbons width
from his accustomed route
the love that would not try
because beside the door
it must be competitions
some unsuspecting horse was tied
surveying his despair
soul take thy risk
with death to be
were better than be not

tell this day endures
ruddy as that coeval apple
the tradition bears
fresh as mankind that humble story
though a statelier tale
grown in the repetition hoary
scarcely would prevail
tell had a son  the ones that knew it
need not linger here
those who did not to human nature
will subscribe a tear
t ell would not bare his head
in presence
of the ducal hat
threatened for that with death  by gessler
tyranny bethought
make of his only boy a target
that surpasses death
stolid to loves supreme entreaty
not forsook of faith
mercy of the almighty begging
tell his arrow sent
god it is said replies in person
when the cry is meant
through what transports of patience
i reached the stolid bliss
to breathe my blank without thee
attest me this and this
by that bleak exultation
i won as near as this
thy privilege of dying
abbreviate me this
a full fed rose on meals of tint
a dmner for a bee
in process of the noon became
each bright mortality
the forfeit is of creature fair
itself adored before
submitting for our unknown sake
to he esteemed no more
distance  is not the realm of fox
nor by relay of bird
abated  distance is
until thyself beloved
lest any doubt that we are glad that they were horn today
whose having lived is held by us in noble holiday
without the date like consciousness or immortality

some days retired from the rest
in soft distinction lie
the day that a companion came
or was obliged to die
best witchcraft is geometry
to the magicians mind
his ordmary acts are feats
to thinking of mankind
great streets of silence led away
to neighborhoods of pause
here was no noticeno dissent
no universeno laws
by clocks twas morning and for night
the bells at distance called
but epoch had no basis here
for period exhaled
he is alive this morning
he is alive  and awake
birds are resuming for him
blossoms  dress for his sake
beesto their loaves of honey
add an amber crumb
him  to regale  me  only
motion and am dumb
trust adjusts her peradventure
phantoms entered and not you
the life we have is very great
the life that we shall see
surpasses it we know because
it is infinity
but when all space has been beheld
and all dominion shown
the smallest human hearts extent
reduces it to none
god made no act without a cause
nor heart without an aim
our inference is premature
our premises to blame
were it to be the last
how infinite would be
what we did not suspect was marked
our final interview
contained in this short life
are magical extents
the soul returning soft at night
to steal securer thence
as children strictest kept
turn soonest to the sea
whose nameless fathoms slink away
beside infinity
of paul and silas it is said
they were in prison laid
but when they went to take them out
they were not there mstead

the staple must be optional
that an immortal binds
alone and in a circumstance
reluctant to be told
a spider on my reticence
assiduously crawled
and so much more at home than i
immediately grew
i felt myself a visitor
and hurriedly withdrew
revisiting my late abode
with articles of claim
i found it quietly assumed
as a gymnasium
where tax asleep and title off
the inmates of the air
perpetual presumption took
as each were special heir
if any strike me on the street
i tan return the blow
if any take my property
according to the law
the statute is my learned friend
but what redress can be
for an offense nor here nor there
so not in equity
that larceny of time and mind
the marrow of the day
by spider or forbid it lord
that i should specify
as old as woe
how old is that
some eighteen thousand years
as old as bliss
how old is that
they are of equal years
together chiefest they are found
but seldom side by side
from neither of them tho he try
can human nature hide
lest they should come is all my fear
when sweet incarcerated here
nature affects to be sedate
upon occasion grand
but let our observation shut
her practices extend
to necromancy and the trades
remote to understand

over every day
by the time that man and beast
put their work away
sunset sounds majestic
but that solemn war
could you comprehend it
you would chastened stare
we like a hairbreadth scape
it tingles in the mind
far after act or accident
like paragraphs of wind
if we had ventured less
the breeze were not so fine
that reaches to our utmost hair
its t entaeles divine
we never know how high we are
till we are asked to rise
and then if we are true to plan
our statures touch the slues

shine thy best
fling up thy balls of gold
till every cubit play with thee
and every crescent hold

upon his atom swim

what we see we know somewhat
be it but a little
what we dont surmise we do
though it shows so fickle
i shall vote for lands with locks
granted i can pickem
transports doubtful dividend
patented by adam
to make routine a stimulus
remember it can cease
capaclty to terminate
is a specific grace
of retrospect the arrow
that power to repair
departed with the torment
become alas more fair
i should not dare to be so sad
so many years again
a load is first impossible
when we have put it down
the superhuman then withdraws
and we who never saw
the giant at the other side
begin to perish now
a soft sea washed around the house
a sea of summer air
and rose and fell the magic planks
that sailed without a care
for captain was the butterfly
for helmsman was the bee
and an entire universe
for the delighted crew
are friends delight or pain
could bounty but remain
riches were good
but if they only stay
ampler to flyaway
riches are sad
because my brook is fluent
i know tis dry
because my brook is silent
it is the sea
and startled at its rising
i try to flee
to where the strong assure me
is no more sea
so i pull my stockings off
wadingm the water
for the disobedience sake
boy that lived for orter
went to heaven perhaps at death
and perhaps he didnt
moses wasnt fairly used
ananias wasnt
the frost was never seen
if met too rapid passed
orm too unsubstantial team
the flowers notice first
a stranger hovermg round
a symptom of alarm
in villages remotely set
but search effaces him
till some retrieveless night
our vigilance at waste
the garden gets the only shot
that never could be traced
unproved is much we know
unknown the worst we fear
of strangers is the earth the inn
of secrets is the air
to analyze perhaps
a philip would prefer
but labor vaster than myself
i find it to infer
the past is such a curious creature
to look herin the face
a transport may receipt us
or a disgrace
unarmed if any meet her
i charge him fly
her faded ammunition
might yet reply
whatever it is  she has tried it
awful father of love
is not ours the chastising
do not chastise the dove
not for ourselves petition
nothmg is left to pray
when a subject is finished
words are handed away
only lest she be lonely
in thy beautiful house
give her for her transgression
license to think of us
lmmortalis an ample word
when what we need is by
but when it leaves us for a time
tis a necessity
of heaven above the firmest proof
we fundamental know
except for its maraudmg hand
it had been heaven below
the show is not the show
but they that go
menagerie to me
my neighbor be
fair play
both went to see
he preached upon breadth till it argued him narrow
the broad are too broad to define
and of truth until it proclaimed him a liar
the truth never haunted a slgn
simplicity fled from his counterfeit presence
as gold the pyrites would shun
what confusion would cover the innocent jesus
to meet so enabled a man
our own possessions  though our own
tis well to hoard anew
remembering the dimensions
of possibility
to disappear enhances
the man that runs away
is tinctured for an instant
with immortality
but yesterday a vagrant
today m memory lain
with superstitious value
we tamper with again
but never far as honor
withdraws the worthless thing
and impotent to cherish
we hasten to adom
of death the sternest function
that just as we discern
the excellence defies us
securest gathered then
the fruit perverse to plucking
but leaning to the sight
vith the ecstatic hmit
of unobtained dehght
the sea said come to the brook

but with ourselves

i bet with every wind that blew
till nature  chagrin
employed a fact to visit me
and scuttle my balloon
a deed knocks first at thought
and then it knocks at will
that is the manufacturing spot
and will at home and well
it then goes out an act
or is entombed so still
that only to the ear of god
its doom is audlble
fortitude incarnate
here is laid away
in the swift partitions
of the awful sea
babble of the happy
cavil of the bold
hoary the fruition
but the sea is old
edifice of ocean
thy tumultuous rooms
suit me at a venture
better than the tombs
let my first knowing be of thee
with mornings warming light
and my first feanng lest unknowns
engulf thee in the night
now i knew i lost her
not that she was gone
but remoteness travelled
on her face and tongue
alien though adjoinmg
as a foreign race
traversed she though pausmg
latitudeless place
elements unaltered
universe the same
but loves transmigration
somehow this had come
henceforth to remember
nature took the day
i had paid so much for
his is penury
not who toils for freedom
or for family
but the restitution
of idolatry
of nature i shall have enough
vvhen i have entered these
entitled to a bumble bees
famuianties
some we see no more tenements of wonder
occupy to us though perhaps to them
simpler are the days than the supposition
their removing manners
leave us to presume
that oblique belief which we call conjecture
grapples with a theme stubborn as sublime
able as the dust to equip its feature
adequate as drums
to enlist the tomb
the riddle we can guess
we speedily despise
not anything is stale so long
as yesterdays surprise
who goes to dine must take his feast
or find the banquet mean
the table is not laid without
till it is laid within
for pattern is the mind bestowed
that imitating her
our most ignoble services
exhibit worthier
like trains of cars on tracks of plush
i hear the level bee
a jar across the flowers goes
their velvet masonry
withstands until the sweet assault
their chivalry consumes
while he victorious tilts away
to vanquish other blooms
its hour with itself
the spmt never shows
what terror would enthrall the street
could countenance disclose
the subterranean freight
the cellars of the soul
thank god the loudest place he made
is hcensed to be still
the popular heart is a cannon first
subsequent a drum
bells for an auxiliary
and an afterward of rum
not a tomorrow to know its name
nor a past to stare
ditches for realms and a tnp to jail
for a souvenir
my tnumph lasted till the drums
had left the dead alone
and then i dropped my victory
and chastened stole along
to where the finished faces
conclusion turned on me
and then i hated glory
and wished myself were they
what is to be is best descried
when it has also been
could prospect taste of retrospect
the tyranmes of men
were tenderer  diviner
the transitive toward
a bayonets contrition
is nothing to the dead
so much of heaven has gone from earth
that there must be a heaven
if only to enclose the saints
to affidavit given
the missionary to the mole
must prove there is a sky
location doubdess he would plead
but what excuse have i
too much of proof affronts belief
the turtle will not try
unless you leave him  then return
and he has hauled away
because he loves her
we will pry and see if she is fair
what difference is on her face
from features others wear
it will not harm her magic pace
that we so far behind
her distances propitiate
as forests touch the w md
not hopmg for his notice vast
but nearer to adore
tis glorys far sufficiency
that makes our trymg poor
it came at last but prompter death
had occupied the house
his pallid furniture arranged
and his metallic peace
oh faithful frost that kept the date
had love as punctual been
delight had aggrandized the gate
and blocked the coming in
somewhere upon the general earth
itself exist today
the magic passive but extant
that consecrated me
indifferent seasons doubtless play
where i for right to be
would pay each atom that i am
but immortahty
reierving that but just to prove
another date of thee
oh god of width do not for tis
curtail eternity
the clovers simple fame
remembered of the cow
is better than enameled realms
of notabulty
renown perceives itself
and that degrades the flower
the daisy that has looked behmd
has compromised its power
had i not seen the sun
i could have borne the shade
but light a newer wilderness
my wilderness has made
if my bark sink
tis to another sea
mortalitys ground floor
is immortality
like rain it sounded till it curved
and then i knew twas wind
it walked as wet as any wave
but swept as dry as sand
when it had pushed itself away
to some remotest plain
a coming as of hosts was heard
that was indeed the rain
it filled the wells it pleased the pools
it warbled in the road
it pulled the spigot from the hills
and let the floods abroad
it loosened acres lifted seas
the sites of centres stirred
then like elijah rode away
upon a wheel of cloud
like times insidious wrinkle
on a beloved face
we clutch the grace the tighter
though we resent the crease
the frost himself so comely
dishevels every pnme
asserting from his prism
that none can punish him
my heart ran so to thee
it would not walt for me
and i affronted grew
and drew away
for whatsoe er my pace
he first achieve thy face
how general a grace
allotted two
not in malignity
mentioned i this to thee
had he obliquity
soonest to share
but for the greed of him
boasting my premium
basking in bethleem
ere i be there
power is a fanuliar growth
not foreign  not to be
beslde us like a bland abyss
in every company
escape it  there is but a chance
when consciousness and clay
lean forward for a final glance
disprove that and you may
risk is the hair that holds the tun
seductive in the air
that tun is hollowbut the tun
with hundred weightsto spare
too ponderous to suspect the snare
espies that fickle chair
and seats itself to be let go
by that perfidious hair
the foolish tun the critics say
while that delusive hair
persuasive as perdition
decoys its traveller
the beggar at the door for fame
were easily supplied
but bread is that diviner thmg
disclosed to be denied
the lilac is an ancient shrub
but ancienter than that
the firmamental lilac
upon the hill tomght
the sun subsiding on his course
bequeaths this final plant
to contemplationnot to touch
the flower of occident
of one corolla is the west
the calyx is the earth
the capsules burnished seeds the stars
the scientist of faith
his research has but just begun
above his synthesis
the flora unimpeachable
to times analysis
eye hath not seen may possibly
be current with the blind
but let not revelation
by theses be detained
to flee from memory
had we the wmgs
many would fly
inured to slower thmgs
birds with surpnse
would scan the cowering van
of men escapmg
from the mind of man
safe despair it is that raves
agony is frugal
puts itself severe away
for its own perusal
garrisoned no soul can be
in the front of trouble
love is one not aggregate
nor is dymg double
the butterflys assumption gown
in chrysoprase apartments hung
this afternoon put on
how condescendmg to descend
and be of buttercups the friend
in a new england town
the suburbs of a secret
a strategist should keep
better than on a dream intrude
to scrutinize the sleep
the butterfly in honored dust
assuredly will he
but none will pass the catacomb
so chastened as the fiy
to pile like thunder to its close
then crumble grand away
while everythmg created hid
this  would be poetry
or love  the two coeval come
we both and neither prove
experience either and consume
for none see god and live
the incidents of love
are more than its events
investments best expositor
is the minute per cents
the stars are old that stood for me
the west a little worn
yet newer glows the only gold
i ever cared to earn
presummg on that lone result
her infinite disdain
but vanquished her with my defeat
twas victory was slain
white as an indian pipe
red as a cardinal flower
fabulous as a moon at noon
february hour
silence is all we dread
theres ransom in a voice
but silence is infimty
himself have not a face
like brooms of steel
the snow and wind
had swept the winter street
the house was hooked
the sun sent out
faint deputies of heat
where rode the bird
the silence tied
his ample plodding steed
the apple in the cellar snug
was all the one that played
had this one day not been
or could it cease to be
how smitten how superfluous
were every other day
lest love should value less
what loss would value more
had it the stricken privilege
it cherishes before
ehjahs wagon knew no thill
was innocent of wheel
elijahs horses as unique
as was his vehicle
elijahs journey to portray
expire with him the skill
who justified elijah
in feats inscrutable
longing is like the seed
that wrestles in the ground
believing if it intercede
it shall at length be found
the hour and the clime
each circumstance unknown
what constancy must be achieved
before it see the sun
not any higher stands the grave
for heroes than for men
not any nearer for the child
than numb three score and ten
this latest leisure equal lulls
the beggar and his queen
propitiate this democrat
a summers afternoon
dominion lasts until obtained
possession just as long
but these  endowing as they hit
eternally belong
how everlasting are the lips
known only to the dew
these are the brides of permanence
supplanting me and you
who were lithe father and the son
we pondered when a child
and what had they to do with us
and when portentous told
with inference appalling
by childhood fortified
we thought at least they are no worse
than they have been described
who are the father and the son
did we demand today
the father and the son himself
would doubtless specify
but had they the felicity
when we desired to know
we better friends had been perhaps
than time ensue to be
we start  to learn that we believe
but onceentlrely
belief it does not fit so well
when altered equently
we blush that heaven if we achieve
event ineffable
we shall have shunned until ashamed
to own the miracle
a wind that rose
though not a leaf
in any forest stirred
but with itself did cold engage
beyond the realm of bird
a wind that woke a lone delight
like separations swell
restored iri arctic confidence
to the invisible
because that you are going
and never coming back
and i however absolute
may overlook your track
because that death is final
however first it be
this instant be suspended
above mortality
significance that each has lived
the other to detect
discovery not god himself
could now annihilate
eternity presumption
the instant i perceive
that you who were existence
yourself forgot to live
the life that is will then have been
a thing i never knew
as paradise fictitious
until the realm of you
the life that is to be to me
a residence too plain
unless in my redeemers face
i recognize your own
of immortality who doubts
he may exchange with me
curtailed by your obscuring face
of everything but he
of heaven and hell i also yield
the right to reprehend
to whoso would commute this face
for his less priceless friend
if god is love as he admits
we think that he must be
because he is a ijealous god
he tells us certainly
if all is possible with him
as he besides concedes
he will refund us finally
our confiscated gods
a word dropped careless on a page
may stimulate an eye
when folded in perpetual seam
the wrinkled maker he
infection in the sentence breeds
we may inhale despair
at dlstances of centuries
from the malaria
i cannot see my soul but know tis there
nor ever saw his house nor furniture
who has invited me with him to dwell
but a confidmg guest consult as well
what raiment honor him the most
that i be adequately dressed
for he insures to none
lest men specifical adorn
procuring him perpetual drest
by dating it a sudden feast
there is no frigate like a book
to take us lands away
nor any coursers like a page
of prancing poetry
this traverse may the poorest take
without oppress of toll
how frugal is the chariot
that bears the human sou
this is the place they hoped before
where i am hoping now
the seed of disappointment grew
within a capsule gay
too rustant to arrest the feet
that walk this plank of balm
before them lies escapeless sea
the way is closed they came
the most triumphant bird i ever knew or met
embarked upon a twig today
and till dominion set
i famish to behold so eminent a sight
and sang for nothing scrutable
but intimate delight
retired and resumed his transitive estate
to what delicious accident
does finest glory fit
when memory is full
put on the perfect lid
this mornings finest syllable
presumptuous evening said
i saw that the flake was on it
but plotted with time to dispute
unchanged i urged with a candor
that cost me my honest heart
but you  she returned with valor
sagacious of my mistake
have altered  accept the pillage
for the progress sake
confirming all who analyze
in the opmion fair
that eloquence is when the heart
has not a voice to spare

is heaven a physician
they say that he can heal
but medicine posthumous
is unavailable
is heaven an exchequer
they speak of what we owe
but that negotiation
im not a party to
septembers baccalaureate
a combination is
of crickets  crows  and retrospects
and a dissembling breeze
that hints without assummg
an innuendo sear
that makes the heart put up its fun
and turn philosopher
so proud she was to die
it made us all ashamed
that what we cherished so unknown
to her desire seemed
so satisfied to go
where none of us should be
immediately  that anguish stooped
almost to jealousy
that sacred closet when you sweep
entitled memory
select a reverential broom
and do it silently
twill be a labor of surprise
besides identity
of other interlocutors
a probability
august the dust of that domain
unchallenged let it lie
you cannot supersede itself
but it can silence you
the bone that has no marrow
what ultimate for that
it is not fit for table
for beggar or for cat
a bone has obligations
a being has the same
a marrowless assembly
is culpabler than shame
but how shall fimshed creatures

old nicodemus phantom
confronting us again i
the splder as an artist
has never been employed
though his surpassing merit
is freely certified
by every broom and bridget
throughout a christian land
neglected son of genius
i take thee by the hand
twas later when the summer went
than when the cricket came
and yet we knew that gentle clock
meant nought but going home
twas sooner when the cricket went
than when the winter came
yet that pathetic pendulum
keeps esoteric time
while we were fearing it it came
but came with less of fear
because that fearing it so long
had almost made it fair
there is a fittinga dismay
a fitting  a despair
tis harder knowmg it is due
than knowing it is here
the trying on the utmost
the mormng it is new
is t erribler than wearing it
a whole existence through
the mountains stood in haze
the valleys stopped below
and went or waited as they liked
the river and the sky
at leisure was the sun
his interests of fire
a little from remark withdrawn
the twilight spoke the spire
so soft upon the scene
the act of evening fell
we felt how neighborly a thing
was the invisible
the way to know the bobolink
from every other bird
precisely as the joy of hidl
obliged to be inferred
of impudent habiliment
attired to defy
impertinence subordinate
at times to majesty
of sentiments seditious
amenable to law
as heresies of transport
or pucks apostacy
extrinsic to attention
too intimate with joy
he complrrnents existence
until allured away
by seasons or his children
adult and urgent grown
or unforeseen aggrandizemen t
or happily renown
by contrast certifying
the bird of birds is gone
how nullified the meadow
her sorcerer withdrawn
the harm of years is on him
the infamy of time
depose him like a fashion
and give dominion room
forget his morning forces
the glory of decay
is a minuter pageant
than least vitality
a stagnant pleasure like a pool
that lets its rushes grow
until they heedless tumble in
and make the water slow
impeding navigatlon bright
of shadows going down
yet even this shall rouse itself
when freshets come along

prosperity
had we our senses
but perhaps tis well theyre not at home
so intimate with madness
hes liable with them
had we the eyes within our head
how well that we are blind
we could not look upon the earth
so utterly unmoved
i know suspense  it steps so terse
and turns so weak away
besides  suspense is neighborly
when i am riding by
is always at the window
though lately i descry
and mention to my horses
the need is not of me
i thought that nature was enough
till human nature came
but that the other did absorb
as parallax a flame
of human nature just aware
there added the dwme
brief struggle for capacity
the power to contain
is always as the contents
but give a giant room
and you will lodge a giallt
and qot a smaller man
in this short life
that only lasts an hour
how much  how little  is
within our power
lain in nature  so suffice us
the enchantless pod
when we advertise existence
for the missing seed
maddest heart that god created
cannot move a sod
pasted by the simple summer
on the longed for dead
left in immortal youth
on that low plain
that hath nor retrospection
nor again
ransomed from years
sequestered from decay
canceled like dawn
in comprehenslve day
the mostathetlc thmg i do
is play i heal from you
i make believe until my hearf
almost believes it too
but when i break it with the news
you knew it was not true
i wish i had not broken it
goliah  so would you
until the desert knows
that water grows
his sands suffice
but let him once suspect
that caspian fact
sahara dies
utmost is relative
have not or have
adjacent sums
enough  the first abode
on the famihar road
galloped in dreams
yesterday is history
tis so far away
yesterday is poetry
tis philosophy
yesterday is mystery
where it is today
while we shrewdly speculate
flutter both away
the thmgs we thought that we should do
we other things have done
but those peculiar industries
have never been begun
the lands we thought that we should seek
when large enough to run
by speculation ceded
to speculations son
the heaven in which we hoped to pause
when discipline was done
untenable to logic
but possibly the one
of life to own
from life to draw
but never touch the reservoir
two lengths has every day
its absolute extent
and area superior
by hope or horror lent
eternity will be
velocity or pause
at fundamental signals
from fundamental laws
to die is not to go
on dooms consummate chart
noterritory new is staked
remain thou as thou art
deaths waylaying not the sharpest
of the thefts of time
there marauds a sorer robber
silence  is his name
no assault nor any menace
doth betoken him
but from lifes consummate cluster
he supplants the balm
go slow my soul to feed thyself
upon his rare approach
go rapid lest competing death
prevail upon the coach
go tiirnd should his final eye
determine thee amiss
go boldlyfor thou paidst his price
redemption  for a kiss
the mushroom is the elf of plants
at evening it is not
at mominst in a t rufred hut

as if it tamed always
and yet its whole career
is shorter than a snakes delay
and heeter than a tare
tis vegetations juggler
the germ of alibi
doth hke a bubble antedate
and hke a bubble hie
i feel as if the grass was pleased
to have it interrnit
this surreptitious scion
of summers circumspect
had nature any supple face
or could she one con temn
had nature an apostate
that mushroom it is him
delights despair at setting
is that deligh t is less
than the sufficing longing
that so impoverish
enchantments perihelion
mistaken oft has been
for the authentic orbit
of its anterior sun
from his slim palace in the dust
he relegates the realm
more loyal for the exody
that has befallen him
i cannot want it more
i cannot want it less
my human natures fullest force
expends itself on this
and yet it nothing is
to him who easy owns
is worth itself or distance
he fathoms who obtains
i think that the root of the wind is water
it would not sound so deep
were it a fmnamental product
furs no oceans keep
mediterranean intonations
to a currents ear
there is a mantime conviction
in the atmosphere
not one by heaven defrauded stay
although he seem to steal
he restitutes in some sweet way
secreted in his will
not with a club the heart is broken
nor with a stone
a whip so small you could not see it
ive known
to lash the magic creature
till it fell
yet that whips name
too noble then to tell

recollect the face of me
when in thy felicity
due in paradise today
guest of mine assuredly
other courtesies have been
other courtesy may be
we commend ourselves to thee
paragon of chivalry
surprise is like a thrilling  pungent
upon a tasteless meat
alone  too acrid  but combined
an edible dehght
that short  potential stir
that each can make but once
that bustle so illustrious
tis almost consequence
is the eclat of death
oh thou unknown renown
that not a beggar would accept
had he the power to spurn
the day she goes
or day she stays
are equally supreme
existence has a stated width
departed or at home
the infinite a sudden guest
has been assumed to be
but how can that stupendous come
which never went away
the notice that is called the spring
is but a month from here
put up my heart thy hoary work
and take a rosy chair
not any house the flowers keep
the birds enamor care
our salary the longest day
is nothing but a bier
this dirty little  heart
is freely mme
i won it with a bun
a freckled shrine
but eligtbly fair
to him who sees
the visage of the soul
and not the knees
to break so vast a heart
required a blow as vast
no zephyr felled this cedar straight
twas undeserved blast

dear march  come in
how glad i am
i hoped for you before
put down your hat
you must have walked
how out of breath you are
dear march how are you and the rest
did you leave nature well
oh march come right up stairs with me
i have so much to teli
i got your letter and the birds
the maples never knew that you were commg  till i called
i declare  how red their faces grew
but march forgive meand
all those hills you left for me to hue
there was no purple suitable
you took it all with you
who knocks that april
lock the door
i will not be pursued
he stayed away a year to call
when i am occupied
but tnfles look so trivial
as soon as you have come
that blame is just as dear as praise
and praise as mere as blame

without the chance of life
afresh annihilating me
that mightiest belief
too mighty for the daily mmd
that tilling its abyss
had madness had it once or twice
the yawning consciousness
beliefs are bandaged like the tongue
when terror were it told
in any tone commensurate
would strike us instant dead
i do not know the man so bold
he dare in lonely place
that awful stranger consciousness
deliberately face
i send you a decrepit flower

at parting  she was going south
and i designed to stay
her motive for the souvenir

or circumstance prudential
withheld invincibly

so scant an interval

has forgot it is there
sedulous of her multitudes

of the ones that pursued it

some  rescinded the wrench

good friends with time
as summer mto autumn slips
and yet we sooner say
the summer than the autumn lest
we tum the sun away

the one that we have loved
so we evade the charge of years
on one attempting shy
the circumvention of the shaft
of lifes declivity
escape is such a thankful word
i often in the night
consider it unto myself

it is to be the saved

reportless also but sincere as nature

elegy of integrity

and this confiding stone
still states to dates that have forgot
the news that she is gone
so constant to its stolid trust
the shaft that never knew
it shames the constancy that fled
before its emblem flew
it sounded as if the streets were running
and then  the streets stood still

perhaps they do not go so far
as we who stay suppose
perhaps come closer for the lapse
of their corporeal clothes
it may be know so certainly
how short we have to fear
that comprehension antedates
and estimates us there
what mystery pervades a well
that water lives so far
a neighbor from another world
residing in a jar
whose limit none have ever seen
but just his lid of glass
like looking every time you please
in an abysss face
the grass does not appear afraid
i often wonder he
can stand so close and look so bold
at what is awe to me
related somehow they may be
the sedge stands next the sea
where he is hoorless
and does no timidity betray
but nature is a stranger yet
the ones that cite her most
have never passed her haunted house
nor simphfied her ghost
to pity those that know her not
is helped by the regret
that those who know her know her less
the nearer her they get
to own a susan of my own
is of itself a bliss
whatever realm i forfeit lord
continue me in this
to the stanch dust
we safe commit thee
tongue if it hath

silence  denote
and sanctity  enforce thee
passenger  of infinity
my maker let me be
enamored most of thee
but nearer this
i more should miss
march is the month of expectation
the things we do not know
the persons of prognostication
are coming now
we try to show becoming firmness
but pompous joy
betrays us as his first betrothal
betrays a boy
bees are black with gilt surcingles
buccaneers of buzz
ride abroad in ostentation
and subsist on fuzz
fuzz ordained  not fuzz contingent
marrows of the hill
jugsa universes fracture
could not jar or spill
no passenger was known to flee
that lodged a night in memory
that wilysubterranean inn
contrives that none go out again
a field of stubble lying sere
beneath the second sun
its toils to brindled people thrust
its triumphsto the bin
accosted by a timid bird
irresolute of alms
is often seen  but seldom felt
on our new england farms
the fact that earth is heaven
whether heaven is heaven or not
if not an affidavit
of that specific spot
not only must confirm us
that it is not for us
but that it would affront us
to dwell in such a place
could mortal lip divine
the undeveloped freight
of a delivered syllable
twould crumble with the weight
i shall not murmur if at last
the ones i loved below
permission have to understand
for what i shunned them so
divulging it would rest my heart
but it would ravage theirs

but its vicinity infer

messenger
shame is the shawl of pink
in which we wrap the soul
to keep it from mfesting eyes
the elemental veil
which helpless nature drops
when pushed upon a scene
repugnant to her probity
shame is the tint divine
sweet skepticism of the heart
that knows  and does not know
and tosses like a fleet of balm
affronted by the snow
invites and then retards the truth
lest certainty be sere
compared with the delicious throe
of transport thrilled with fear
unworthy of her breast
though by that scathing test
what soul survive
by her exacting light
how counterfeit the whlte
we chiefly have
a wild blue sky abreast of winds
that threatened it  did run
and crouched behind his yellow door
was the defiant sun
some conflict with those upper friends
so genial in the main
that we deplore peculiarly
their arrogant campaign
crisis is sweet and yet the heart
upon the hither side
has dowers of prospective
to denizens denied
inquire of the closing rose
which rapture she preferred
and she will pomt you sighing
to her rescinded bud
how human nature dotes
on what it cant detect
the moment that a plot is plumbed
prospective is extmct
prospective is the friend
reserved for us to know
when constancy is clarified
of curiosity
of subjects that resist
redoubtablest is this

creation after this
how lonesome the wind must feel nights
when people have put out the lights
and everything that has an inn
closes the shutter and goes in
how pompous the wind must feel noons
steppmg to incorporeal tunes
correcting errors of the sky
and clarifying scenery
how mighty the wind must feel moms
encamping on a thousand dawns
espousing each and spurnmg all
then soaring to his temple t all
it was a quiet seeming day
there was no hann in earth or sky
till with the closing sun
there strayed an accidental red
a strolling hue one would have said
to westward of the town
but when the earth began to jar
and houses vanished with a roar
and human nature hid
we comprehended by the awe
as those that dlssolution saw
the poppy in the cloud
one joy of so much anguish
sweet nature has for me
i shun it as i do despair
or dear iniquity
why birds a summer morning
before the qulck of day
should stab my ravished splrit
with dirks of melody
is part of an inqmry

summer has two beginmngs

beatified
without a vaunt or sheen
as casual as rain
and as benign

and aid an aged year
abundant end

fidelity is gain
creation oer
the inundation of the spring
enlarges every soul
it sweeps the tenement away
but leaves the water whole
in which the soul at first estranged
seeks faintly for its shore
but acclimatedpines no more
for that peninsula
the pretty rain from those sweet eaves
her unmtendmg eyes
took her own heart includmg ours
by mnocent surprise
the wrestle in her simple throat
to hold the feeling down
that vanquished her  defeated feat
was fervors sudden crown
to earn it by disdaining it
is fames consummate fee
he loves what spurns him
look behind  he is pursuing thee
so let us gather  every day
the aggregate of
lifes bouquet
be honor and not shame
water makes many beds
for those averse to sleep
its awful chamber open stands
its curtains blandly sweep
abhorrent is the rest
in undulating rooms
whose amplitude no end invades
whose axis never comes
we shun because we prize her face
lest sights ineffable disgrace
our adoration stain
who never wantedmaddestjoy
remains to him unknown
the banquet of abstemiousness
defaces that of wine
within its reach though yet ungrasped
desires perfect goal
no nearerlest the actual
should disenthrall thy soul
with pinions of disdain
the soul can farther fly
than any feather specified
in ornithology
it wafts this sordid flesh
beyond its dull control
and during its electric gale
the body is a soul
instructmg by the same
how little work it be
to put off filaments like this
for immortality
spurn the temerity
rashness of calvary
gay were gethsemane
knew we of thee
how brittle are the piers
on which our faith doth tread
no bridge below doth totter so
yet none hath such a crowd
it is as old as god

he sent his son to test the plank
and he pronounced it firm
go not too near a house of rose
the depredation of a breeze
or inundation of a dew
alarms its walls away
nor try to tie the butterfly
nor climb the bars of ecstasy
in insecurity to lie
is joys insuring quality
not that he goeswe love him more
who led us while he stayed
beyond earths trafficking frontier
for what he moved he made
tban heaven more remote
for heaven is the root
but these the flitted seed
more flown indeed
than ones that never were
or those that hide and are
what madness by their side
a vision to provide
of future days
they cannot pralse
my soul to find them come
they cannot call theyre dumb
nor prove nor woo
but that they have abode
is absolute as god
and instant too
a dew sufficed itself
and satisfied a leaf
and felt how vast a destiny
how trivial is life
the sun went out to work
the day went out to play
and not again that dew be seen
by physiognomy
whether by day abducted
or emptied by the sun
into the sea in passing
eternally unknown
attested to this day
that awful tragedy
by transports instability
and dooms celerity
behold this little bane
the boon of all alive
as common as it is unknown
the name of it is love
to lack of it is woe
to own of it is wound
not elsewhereif in paradise
its tantamount be found
how ruthless are the gentle
how cruel are the kind
god broke his contract to his lamb
to qualify the wind
the healed heart shows its shallow scar
with confidential moan
not mended by mortality
are fabrics truly torn
to go its convalescent way
so shameless is to see
more genume were perfidy
than such fidelity
these fevered days  to take them to the forest
where waters cool around the mosses crawl
and shade is all that devastates the stlllness
seems it sometimes this would be all
to mend each tattered faith
there is a needle fair
though no appearance indicate
tis threaded in the air
and though it do not wear
as if it never tore
tis very comfortable indeed
and spacious as before
a chilly peace infests the grass
the sun respectful lies
not any t ranee of industry
these shadows scrutinize
whose allies go no more astray
for service or for glee
but all mankmd deliver here
from whatsoever sea
a little snow was here and there
disseminated in her hair
since she and i had met and played
decade had gathered to decade
but time had added not obtained
impregnable the rose
for summer too indelible
too obdurate for snows
death is the supple suitor
that wins at last
it is a stealthy wooing
conducted first
by pallid innuendoes
and dim approach
but brave at last with bugles
and a bisected coach
it bears away in triumph
to troth unknown
and kindred as responsive
as porcelain
his mind like fabrics of the east
displayed to the despair
of everyone but here and there
an humble purchaser
for though his price was not of gold
more arduous there is
that one should comprehend the worth
was all the pnce there was
how good his lava bed
to thls laborious boy
who must be up to call the world
and dress the sleepy day
how soft a caterpillar steps
i find one on my hand
from such a velvet world it comes
such plushes at command
its soundless travels just arrest
my slowterrestrial eye
intent upon its own career
what use has it for me
i thought the train would never come
how slow the whistle sang
i dont believe a peevlsh bird
so whimpered for the spring
i taught my heart a hundred times
precisely what to say
provoking lover when you came
its treatise flew away
to hide my strategy too late
to wiser be too soon
for miseries so halcyon
the happiness atone
the road was lit with moon and star
the trees were bright and still
descned i  by the distant light
a traveller on a hill
to magic perpendiculars
ascending though terrene
unknown his shimmering ultimate
but he indorsed the sheen
whoever disenchants
a single human soul
by failure of irreverence
is guilty of the whole
as guileless as a bird
as graphic as a star
till the suggestion sinister
things are not what they are
your thoughts dont have words every day
they come a single time
like signal esoteric sips
of the communion wine
which while you taste so native seems
so easy so to be
you cannot comprehend its price
nor its infrequency
a counterfeit  a plated person
i would not be
whatever strata of iniquity
my nature underlie
truth is good healthand safety and the sky
how meagre what an exile  is a lie
and vocalwhen we die
those not live yet
who doubt to live again
again is of a twice
but this  is one
the ship beneath the draw
aground  is he
death  so  the hyphen of the sea
deep is the schedule
of the disk to be
costumeless consciousness
that is he
opinion is a flitting thing
but truth outlasts the sun
if then we cannot own them both
possess the oldest one
so gay a hower
bereaves the mind
as if it were a woe
is beauty an affiiction  then
tradition ought to know
it stole along so stealthy
suspicion it was done
was dim as to the wealthy
beginning not to own
times wily chargers will not wait
at any gate but woes
but there  so gloat to hesitate
they will not stir for blows
belshazzar had a letter
he never had but one
belshazzars correspondent
concluded and begun
in that immortal copy
the conscience of us all
can read without its glasses
on revelations wall
his cheek is his biographer
as long as he can blush
perdition is opprobrium
past that he sins in peace
heavenly father  take to thee
the supreme iniquity
fashioned by thy candid hand
in a moment contraband
though to trust us  seem to us
more respectful we are dust
we apologize to thee
for thme own duplicity

we knew not that we were to live
not whenwe are to die
our ignorance  our cuirass is
we wear mortality
as lightly as an option gown
till asked to take it off
by his intrusion god is known
it is the same with life
a route of evanescence
with a revolving wheel
a resonance of emerald
a rush of cochineal
and every blossom on the bush
adjusts its tumbled head
the mail from tunis probably
an easy mornings ride
one thing of it we borrow
and promise to return
the booty and the sorrow
its sweetness to have known
one thing of it we covet
the power to forget
the anguish of the avarice
defrays the dross of it
before you thought of spring
except as a surmise
you see  god bless his suddenness
a fellow in the skies
of independent hues
a little weather worn
inspiriting habiliments
of inchgo and brown
with specimens of song
as if for you to choose
discretion in the mterval
with gay delays he goes
to some superior tree
without a single leaf
and shouts for joy to nobody
but his seraphic self
one of the ones that midas touched
who failed to touch us all
was that confiding prodigal
the reeling oriole
so drunk he disavows it
with badmage divine
so dazzling we mistake him
for an alighting mine
a pleadera dissembler
an epicure  a thief
betimes an oratorio
an ecstasy in chief
the jesuit of orchards
he cheats as he enchants
of an entlre attar
for his decampmg wants
the splendor of a burmah
the meteor of birds
departing like a pageant
of ballads and of bards
i never thought that jason sought
for any golden fleece
but then i am a rural man
with thoughts that make for peace
but if there were a jason
tradition bear with me
behold his lost aggrandizement
upon the apple tree
a little overflowing word
that any hearing had inferred
for ardor or for tears
though generations pass away
traditions ripen and decay
as eloquent appears
a winged spark doth soar about
i never met it near
for lightning it is oft mistook
when nights are hot and sere
its rninkhng travels it pursues
above the haunts of men
a speck of rapture  first perceived
by feelmg it is gone
rekmdled by some action quaint
if wrecked upon the shoal of thought
how is it with the sea
the only vessel that is shunned
is safe simplicity
the sweets of pillage can be known
to no one but the thief
compassion for integrity
is his divinest grief
their barricade against the sky
the martial trees withdraw
and with a flag at every turn
their armies are no more
what russet halts in natures march
they indicate or cause
an inference of mexico
effaces the surmise
recurrent to the after mind
that massacre of air
the wound that was not wound nor scar
but hohdays of war
to see the summer sky
is poetry though never in a book it he
true poems hee
we talked with each other about each other
though neither of us spoke
we were listening to the seconds races
and the hoofs of the clock
pausing in front of our palsied faces
time compassion took
arks of reprieve he offered to us
ararats  we took
estranged from beautynone can he
for beauty is infinity
and power to be finite ceased
before identity was leased
fame is the one that does not stay
its occupant must die
or out of sight of estimate
ascend incessantly
or be that most insolvent thing
a lightning in the germ
electrical the embryo
but we demand the flame
his voice decrepit was with joy
her words did totter so
how old the news of love must be
to make lips elderly
that purled a moment since with glee
is it delight or woe
or terror  that do decorate
this livid interview
how destitute is he
whose gold is firm
who finds it every time
the small stale sum
when love with but a pence
will so display
as is a disrespect
to india
look back on time with kindly eyes
he doubtless did his best
how softly sinks that trembling sun
in human natures west
the devil had he fidelity
would be the best friend
because he has ability
but devils cannot mend
perfidy is the vlrtue

the fascinating chill that music leaves
is earths corroboration
of ecstasys impediment

in timid and tumultuous soil
a fine  estranging creature
to something upper vloomg us
but not to our creator
the way hope builds his house
it is not with a sill
nor rafter  has that edlfice
but only pinnacle
abode in as supreme
this superficies
as if it were of ledges smit
or mortised with the laws
tis whiter than an indian pipe
tis dimmer than a lace
no stature has it like a fog
when you approach the place
not any voice imply it here
or mtimate it there
a spirit  how doth it accost
what function hath the air
this limitless hyperbole
each one of us shall be
tis drama  if hypothesis
it be not tragedy
the robm is a gabriel
in humble circumstances
his dress denotes him socially
of transports workmg classes
he has the punctuality
of the new england farmer
the same oblique integrity
a vista vastly warrner
a small but sturdy residence
a self denying household
the guests of perspicacity
are all that cross his threshold
as covert as a fugitive
cajolmg consternatlon
by ditties to the enemy
and sylvan punctuation
we shall find the cube of the rainbow
of that there is no doubt
but the arc of a lovers conjecture
eludes the finding out
love is done when loves begun
sages say
but have sages known
truth adjourn your boon
without day
her spirit rose to such a height
her countenance it did inflate
like one that fed on awe
more prudent to assault the dawn
than merit the ethereal scorn
that effervesced from her
the savior must have been
a docile gentleman
to come so far so cold a day
for little fellowmen
the road to bethlehem
smce he and i were boys
was leveled but for that twould be
a rugged billion miles
birthday of but a single pang
that there are less to come
afhictive is the adjective
but affluent the doom
a dimple in the tomb
makes that ferocious room
a home
the face m evanescence lain
is more distinct than ours
and ours surrendered for its sake
as capsules are for flowers
or is it the confidmg sheen
dissenting to be won
descending to enamor us
of detriment divine
the road to paradise is plain
and holds scarce one
not that it is not firm
but we presume
a dimpled road
is more preferred
the belles of paradise are few
not me  nor you
but unsuspected things
mines have no wings
and with what body do they comet
then they do come  rejoice
what door what hour run run  my soul
illuminate the house
body then reala face and eyes

paul knew the man that knew the news
he passed through bethlehem
could that sweet darkness where they dwell
be once disclosed to us
the clamor for their loveliness
would burst the lonelmess
the competitions of the sky
corrodeless ply
the thrill came slowly like a boon for
centuries delayed
its fitness growing like the flood
in sumptuous solitude
the desolation only missed
while rapture changed its dress
and stood amazed before the change
in ravished holiness
all that i do
is in review
to his enamored mind
i know his eye
where eer i ply
is pushing close behind
not any port
nor any hight
but he doth there preside
what ommpresence lies in wait
for her to be a bride
facts by our side are never sudden
until they look around
and then they scare us like a spectre
protrudmg from the ground
the height of our portentous neighbor
we never know
till summoned to his recogmtion
by an adieu
adieu for whence
the sage cannot conjecture
the bravest die
as ignorant of their resumption
asyouori
glass was the street  in tinsel peril
tree and traveller stood
filled was the air with merry venture
hearty with boys the road
shot the lithe sleds like shod vibrations
emphasized and gone
it is the pasts supreme italic
makes this present mean
how finn etermty must look
to crumbling men like me
the only adamant estate
in all identity
how mlghty to the insecure
thy physiognomy
to whom not any face cohere
unless concealed in thee
it came his tum to beg
the begging for the life
is different from another alms
tis penury in chief
i scanned his narrow realm
i gave him leave to live
lest gratitude revive the snake
though smuggled his reprieve
its little ether hood
doth sit upon its head
the millinery supple
of the sagacious god
till when it slip away
a nothing at a time
and dandelions drama
expires in a stem
i saw the wind within her
i knew it blew for me
but she must buy my shelter
i asked humility
more than the grave is closed to me
the grave and that eternity
to which the grave adheres
i cling to nowhere till i fall
the crash of nothing yet of al
how similar appears
of whom so dear
the name to hear
illumines with a glow
as intimateas fugitive
as sunset on the snow
she could not live upon the past
the present did not know her
and so she sought this sweet at last
and nature gently owned her
the mother that has not a knell
for either duke or robin
summer is shorter than any one
life is shorter than summer
seventy years is spent as quick
as an only dollar
sorrownowis politeand stays
see how well we spurn hlm
equally to abhor delight
equally retain hlm
the pue of years is not so high
as when you came before
but it is rising every day
from recollections floor
and while by standing on my heart
i still can reach the top
efface the mountain with your face
and catch me ere i drop
you cannot make remembrance grow
when it has lost its root
the tightening the sou around
and setting it upright
deceives perhaps the umverse
but not retrieves the plant
real memory like cedar feet
is shod with adamant
nor can you cut remembrance down
when it shall once have grown
its iron buds will sprout anew
however overthrown
mme enemy is growing old
i have at last revenge
the palate of the hate departs
if any would avenge
let him be quick  the viand bits
it is a faded meat
anger as soon as fed is dead
tis starving makes it fat
how happy is the httle stone
that rambles in the road alone
and doesnt care about careers
and exigencies never fears
whose coat of elemental brown
a passmg universe put on
and independent as the sun
associates or glows alone
fulfilling absolute decree
in casual simplicity
my country need not change her gown
her triple suit as sweet
as when twas cut at lexington
and first pronounced a fit
great britain chsapproves the stars
disparagement discreet
theres something in their attitude
that taunts her bayonet
all thmgs swept sole away
this  is immensity

her travels dally be
by routes of ecstasy
to evenings sea
an antiquated tree
is cherished of the crow
because that junior foliage is disrespectful now
to venerable birds
whose corporation coat
would decorate oblivions
remotest consulate
the thmgs that never can come back are several
childhood  some forms of hope  the dead
though joyslike menmay sometunes make a journey
and still abide
we do not mourn for traveler or sailor
their routes are fair
but think enlarged of all that they will tell us

for thou hast borne a universe

astonishes the grass
and winter instantly becomes
an infinite alas

has still a silent rank
the bearer from an emerald court
of a despatch of pink

and hasnt any home
is just as high as you and i
and higher i believe
so soar away and never sigh
and thats the way to grieve

allures his jaded eye
that lowly breast where butterflies
have felt it meet to die
oh give it motion  deck it sweet
with artery and vein
upon its fastened lips lay words
affiance it again
to that pink stranger we call dust
acquamted more with that
than with this horizontal one
that will not lift its hat
the moon upon her fluent route
defiant of a road
the stars etruscan argument
substantiate a god
if aims impel these astral ones
the ones allowed to know
know that which makes them as forgot
as dawn forgets them  now
tis seasons since the dimpled war
in which we each were conqueror
and each of us were slain
and centuries twill be and more
another massacre before
so modest and so vain
without a fonnula we fought
each was to each the pink redoubt
a pang is more conspicuous in spring
in contrast with the thmgs that sing
not birds entirely  but minds
minute effulgencies and winds
when what they sung for is undone
who cares about a blue brrds tune
why resurrection had to wait
till they had moved a stone
above oblivions tide there is a pier
and an effaceless few are lifted there
nay lift themselves  fame has no arms
and but one smile  that meagres balms
from all the jails the boys and girls
ecstatically leap
beloved only afternoon
that prison doesnt keep
they stann the earth and stun the air
a mob of solid bliss
alas  that frowns should lie in wait
for such a foe as this
on that specific pillow
our projects hit away
the nights tremendous morrow
and whether sleep will stay
or usher us  a stranger
to situations new
the effort to compnse it
is all the soul can do
society for me my misery
since gift of thee
the life that tied too tight escapes
will ever after run
with a prudential look behind
and spectres of the rein
the horse that scents the living grass
and sees the pastures smile
will be retaken with a shot
if he is caught at all
there comes a warmng like a spy
a shorter breath of day
a stealing that is not a stealth
and summers are away
candormy tepid friend
come not to play with me
the myrrhs and mochas of the mind
are its iniquity

and if thou live before thou wake
i pray the lord thy soul to make
as imperceptibly as grief
the summer lapsed away
too imperceptible at last
to seem hke perfidy
a quietness distilled
as twilight long begun
or nature spending with herself
sequestered afternoon
the dusk drew earlier in
the morning foreign shone
a courteous yet harrowing grace
as guest that would be gone
and thus without a wing
or service of a keel
our summer made her light escape
into the beautiful
no matter where the saints abide
they make their circuit fair
behold how great a firmament
accompanies a star
come show thy durham breast
to her who loves thee best
delicious robin

but destiny is old
and economical of bliss
as midas is of gold

a foe whom i have never seen
but oft has scanned me oer
and hesitated me between
and others at my side
but chose the best neglecting me till
all the rest have died
how sweet if r am not forgot
by chums that passed away
smce playmates at threescore and ten
are such a scarcity
the pattern of the sun
can fit but him alone
for sheen must have a disk
to be a sun
those  dying then
knew where they went
they went to gods right hand
that hand is amputated now
and god cannot be found
the abdication of belief
makes the behavior small
better an ignis fatuus
than no illume at all
within thy grave
oh no but on some other hight
thou only camest to mankind
to rend it with good night
bliss is the plaything of the child

the sacred stealth of boy and girl

with solemn nameless need

for this foreshadowed food
which others taste and spurn and sneer
though i within suppose
that consecrated it could be
the only food that grows
image of light adieu
thanks for the interview
so longso short
preceptor of the whole
coeval cardinal
impart depart
lives he in any other world
my faith cannot reply
before it was imperative
twas all distinct to me
of death i try to think like this
the well in which they lay us
is but the likeness of the brook
that menaced not to slay us
but to invite by that dismay
which is the zest of sweetness
to the same flower hesperian
decoying but to greet us
i do remember when a child
with bolder playmates straying
to where a brook that seemed a sea
withheld us by its roaring
from just a purple flower beyond
until constrained to clutch it
if doom itself were the result
the boldest leaped and clutched it
tried always and condemned by thee
permit me this reprieve
that dying i may earn the look
for which i cease to live
to be forgot by thee
surpasses memory
of other minds
the heart cannot forget
unless it contemplate
what it declines
i was regarded then
raised from oblrvion
a single time
to be remembered what
wolthy to be forgot
is my renown
no brigadier throughout the year
so civic as the jay
a neighbor and a warrior too
with shrill felrcity
pursuing winds that censure us
a february day
the brother of the universe
was never blown away
the snow and he are intimate
ive often seen them play
when heaven looked upon us all
with such severity
i felt apology were due
to an insulted sky
whose pompous frown was nutriment
to their temerity
the pillow of this daring head
is pungent evergreens
his larderterse and milltant
unknown  refreshing things
his character  a tonic
his futurea dispute
unfair an immortality
that leaves this neighbor out
her losses make our gams ashamed
she bore lifes empty pack
as gallantly as if the east
were swmgmg at her back
lifes empty pack is heaviest
as every porter knows
in vain to punish honey
it only sweeter grows
by homely gift and hmdered words
the human heart is told
of nothmg
nothing is the force
that renovates the world
pass to thy rendezvous of light
pangless except for us
who slowly ford the mystery
which thou hast leaped across
some arrows slay but whom they strike
but this slew all but him
who so appareled his escape
too trackless for a tomb
climbing to reach the costly hearts
to which he gave the worth
he broke them fearmg punishment
he ran away from earth
the heart has many doors
i can but knock
for any sweet corne in
impelled to hark
not saddened by repulse
repast to me
that somewhere there exists
supremacy
to see her is a picture
to hear her is a tune
to know her an intemperance
as innocent as june
to know her not  affiiction
to own her for a friend
a warmth as near as if the sun
were shining in your hand
the clock strikes one that just struck two
some schism in the sum
a vagabond for genesis
has wrecked the pendulum
forever honored be the tree
whose apple winterworn
enticed to breakfast from the sky
two gabriels yestermorn
they regtstered m natures book
as robms  sire and son
but angels have that modest way
to screen them from renown
how slow the wind
how slow the sea
how late their feathers be
we wear our sober dresses when we die
but summer frilled as for a holiday
adjourns her sigh
to the bnght east she hies
brothers of paradise
remit her home
without a change of wings
or loves convenient thmgs
enticed to come
fashioning what she is
fathoming what she was
we deem we dxeam
and that dissolves the days
through which existence strays
homeless at home
no ladder needs the bird but skies
to situate its wmgs
nor any leaders grim baton
arraigns it as it sings
the implements of bliss are few
as jesus says of him
come unto me the moiety
that wafts the cherubim
the bat is dun with wrinkled wings
like fallow article
and not a song pervade his lips
or none perceptible
his small umbrella quaintly halved
describmg in the air
an arc alike inscrutable
elate philosopher
deputed from what firmament
of what astute abode
empowered with what malignity
auspiciously withheld
to his adroit creator
ascnbe no less the praise
beneficent believe me
his eccentricities
the spirit lasts  but in what mode
below the body speaks
but as the spirit furnishes
apart it never talks
the music in the violin
does not emerge alone
but arm in arm with touch yet touch
alone  is not a tune
the spirit lurks within the flesh
like tides within the sea
that make the water live estranged
what would the either be
does that know  now  or does it cease
that which to this is done
resuming at a mutual date
with every future one
instinct pursues the adamant
exacting this reply
adversity if it may be or
wild prosperity
the rumors gate was shut so tight
before my mind was sown
not even a prognostics push
could make a dent thereon
morning is due to all
to somethe night
to an imperial few
the auroral light
blossoms will run away
cakes reign but a day
but memory like melody
is pink eternally
it would not know if it were spurned
this gallant htde hower
how therefore safe to be a hower
if one would tamper there
to enter it would not aspire
but may it not despair
that it is not a cavalier
to dare and perish there
we shun it ere it comes
afraid of joy
then sue it to delay
and lest it hy
beguile it more and more
may not this be
old suitor heaven
like our dismay at thee

was nearer than the sky
and rumbles still though torrid noons
have lain their missiles by
the lightning that preceded it
struck no one but myself
but i would not exchange the bolt
for all the rest of life
indebtedness to oxygen
the happy may repay
but not the obligation
to electncity
it founds the homes and decks the days
and every clamor bright
is but the gleam concomitant
of that waylaymg light
the thought is quiet as a flake
a crash without a sound
how lifes reverbetatlon
its explanation found
where roses would not dare to go
what heart would risk the way
and so i send my crimson scouts
to sound the enemy
witchcraft was hung in history
but history and i
find all the witchcraft that we need
around us every day
expanse cannot be lost
not joy but a decree
is deity
his scene infinity
whose rumors gate was shut so tight
before my beam was sown
not even a prognostics push
could make a dent thereon
the world that thou hast opened
shuts for thee
but not alone
we all have followed thee
escape more slowly
to thy tracts of sheen
the tent is listemng
but the troops are gone
the bll d her punctual music bnngs
and lays it in its place
its place is in the human heart
and in the heavenly grace
what respite from her thrilling toil
did beauty ever take
but work might be electric rest
to those that magic make
to her derided home
a weed of summer came
she did not know her station low
nor ignominys name
bestowed a summer long
upon a fameless bower
then swept as lightly from disdain
as lady from her bower
of bliss the codes are few
as jesus cites of him
come unto me the moiety
that wafts the seraphim
he ate and drank the precious words
his spirit grew robust
he knew no more that he was poor
nor that his frame was dust
he danced along the dingy days
and this bequest of wings
was but a book what liberty
a loosened spirit brings
this methat walks and worksmust die
some fair or stormy day
adversity if it may be
or wild prosperity
the rumors gate was shut so tight
before my mind was born
not even a prognostics push
can make a dent thereon
cosmopolites without a plea
alight in every land
the compliments of paradise
from those within my hand
their dappled journey to themselves
a compensation fair
knock and it shall be opened
is their theology
not at home to callers
says the naked tree
bonnet due m apnl
wishmg you good day
the bobolink is gone
the rowdy of the meadow
and no one swaggers now but me
the presbyterian birds
can now resume the meeting
he boldly mterrupted thatoverbowing day
when supplicating mercy
in a portentous way
he swung upon the decalogue
and shouted let us pray
the lassitudes of contemplation
beget a force
they are the spints soli vacation
that him refresh
the dreams consolidate in action
what mettle fair
there came a wind like a bugle
it quivered through the grass
and a green chill upon the heat
so ominous did pass
we barred the windows and the doors
as from an emerald ghost
the dooms electric moccasin
that very instant passed
on a strange mob of panting trees
and fences fled away
and rivers where the houses ran
those looked that lived  that day
the bell within the steeple wild
the hymg tidmgs told
how much can come
and much can go
and yet abide the world
immured in heaven
what a celli
let every bondage be
thou sweetest of the umverse
like that which ravished thee
declaiming waters none may dread
but waters that are still
are so for that most fatal cause
in naturethey are full
few yet enough
enough is one
to that ethereal throng
have not each one of us the right
to stealthily belong
tis not the swaying frame we miss
it is the steadfast heart
that had it beat a thousand years
with love alone had bent
its fervor the electric oar
that bore it through the tomb
ourselves denied the privilege
consolelessly presume
who is it seeks my pillow nights
with plain inspectmg face
dd        or  you not
youdod              tok
tis conscience childhoods nurse
with martial hand she strokes the hair
upon my wincing head
all rogues shall have their part m what
the phosphorus of god
though the great waters sleep
that they are still the deep
we cannot doubt
no vacillating god
ignited this abode
to put itout
upon his saddle sprung a bird
and crossed a thousand trees
before a fence without a fare
his fantasy did please
and then he lifted up his throat
and squandered such a note
a universe that overheard
is stricken by it yet
of god we ask one favor
that we may be forgiven
for what he is presumed to know
the crime from us is hidden
immured the whole of life
within a magic prison
we reprimand the happiness
that too competes with heaven
pursuing you in your transitions
in other motes
of other myths
your requlsltion be
the prism never held the hues
it only heard them play
the going from a world we know
to one a wonder still
is like the childs adversity
whose vista is a hill
behind the hill is sorcery
and everythmg unknown
but will the secret compensate
for climbing it alone
we send the wave to find the wave
an errand so divine
the messenger enamored too
forgetting to return
we make the wise distinction snll
soever made m vain
the sagest time to dam the sea is when the sea is gone
each that we lose takes part of us
a crescent still abides
which like the moon some turbid mght
is summoned by the tides
quite empty quite at rest
the robin locks her nest and tries her wings
she does not know a route
but puts her craft about
for rumored springs
she does not ask for noon
she does not ask for boon
crumbless and homeless of but one request
the birds she lost
within that little hive
such hmts of honey lay
as made reality a dream
and dreams reality
c z                                     z z
the ecstasy to guess
were a receipted bliss
if grace could talk
sunset that screens reveals
enhancing what we see
by menaces of anlethyst
and moats of mystery
morning that comes but once
considers coming twice
two dawns upon a single mom
make life a sudden price
c z                                     z
their dappled importunity
disparage or dismiss
the obloquies of etiquette
are obsolete to bliss
the auctloneer of parting
his going going gone
shouts even from the crucifix
and brings his hammer down
he only sells the wilderness
the prices of despair
range from a smgle human heart
to two  not any more
not sickness stains the brave
nor any dart
nor doubt of scene to come
but an adjourning heart
parting with thee reluctantly
that we have never met
a heart sometimes a foreigner
remembers it forgot
oh what a grace is this
what majesties of peace
that having breathed
the fineensuing right
without diminuet proceed
who abdicated ambush
and went the way of dusk
and now against his subtle name
there stands an asterisk
as confident of him as we
impregnable we are
the whole of immortality
secreted in a star
to try to speak and miss the way
and ask it of the tears
is gratitudes sweet poverty
the tatters that he wears
a better coat if he possessed
would help him to conceal
not subjugate the mutineer
whose title is the soul
there are two mays
and then a must
and after that a shall
how mfimte the compromise
that indicates i will
not knowing when the dawn will come
i open every door
see poem
or has it feathers like a bird
or blllows like a shore
circumference thou bride of awe
possessing thou shalt be
possessed by every hallowed knight
that dares to covet thee
a flower will not trouble her it has so small a foot
and yet if you compare the lasts
hers is the smallest boot
a sloop of amber shps away
upon an ether sea
and wrecks in peace a purple tar
the son of ecstasy
a world made penniless by that departure
of minor fabrics begs
but sustenance is of the spirit
the gods but dregs
apparently with no surprise
to any happy flower
the frost beheads it at its play
in accidental power
the blonde assassin passes on
the sun proceeds unmoved
to measure off another day
for an approving god
back from the cordial grave i drag thee
he shall not take thy hand
nor put his spacious arm around thee
that none can understand
no life can pompless pass away
the lowliest career
to the same pageant wends its way
as that exalted here
how cordial is the mystery
the hospitable pall
a this way beckons spaclously
a miracle for alll
the pedigree of honey
does not concern the bee
nor lineage of ecstasy
delay the butterfly
on spangled journeys to the peak
of some perceiveless thing
the right of way to tripoli
a more essential thing

the pedigree of honey
does not concern the bee
a clover any time to him
is aristocracy

a drunkard cannot meet a cork
without a revery
and so encountering a fly
this january day
jamaicas of remembrance stir
that send me reeling in
the moderate drinker of delight
does not deserve the spnng
of juleps part are in the jug
and more are in the joy
your connoisseur in liquors
consults the bumble bee
arrows enamored of his heart
forgot to rankle there
and venoms he mistook for balms
disdained to rankle there
as from the earth the light balloon
asks nothing but release
ascension that for which it was
its soaring residence
the spmt looks upon the dust
that fastened it so long
wlth indlgnation
as a blrd
defrauded of its song
oh future thou secreted peace
or subterranean woe
is there no wandering route of grace
that leads away from thee
no circuit sage of all the course
descried by cunning men
to balk thee of thy sacred prey
advancmg to thy den
so give me back to death
the death i never feared
except that it deprived of thee
and now by llfe deprived
in my own grave i breathe
and estimate its size
its size is all that hell can guess
and all that heaven was
still own thee  still thou art
what surgeons call alive
though slippingslipping i perceive
to thy reportless grave
which question shall i clutch
what answer wrest from thee
before thou dost exude away
in the recallless sea
talk not to me of summer trees
the foliage of the mind
a tabernacle is for birds
of no corporeal kind
and winds do go that way at noon
to their ethereal homes
whose bugles call the least of us
to undepicted realms
the jay his castanet has struck
put on your muff for winter
the tippet that ignores his voice
is impudent to nature
of swarthy days he is the close
his lotus is a chestnut
the cricket drops a sable line
no more from yours at present
the sun in reining to the west
makes not as much of sound
as cart of man in road below
adroitly turning round
that whihetree of amethyst
is it too late to touch you dear
we this moment knew
love marine and love terrene
love celestial too
go thy great way
the stars thou meetst
are even as thyself
for what are stars but asterisks
to point a human life
a letter is a joy of earth
it is demed the gods
take all away from me but leave me ecstasy
and i am richer then than all my fellow men
iii it becometh me to dwell so wealthily
when at my very door are those possessing more
in abject poverty
betrothed to righteousness might be
an ecstasy discreet
but nature relishes the pinks
which she was taught to eat
red sea mdeed talk not to me
of purple pharaoh
i have a navy in the west
would pierce his columns thro
guileless yet of such glory fine
that all along the lme
is it or is it not marine
is it or not divine
the eye inquires with a sigh
that earth shd be so big
what exultation in the woe
what wine in the fatigue
extol thee  could i then i will
by saying noiliing new
but just the truest truth
that thou art heavenly
perceiving thee is evidence
that we are of the sky
partaking thee a guaranty
of immortality
some one prepared this mighty show
to which without a ticket go
the nations and the days
displayed before the simplest door
that all may witness it and more
the pomp of summer days
the ditch is dear to the drunken man
for is it not his bed
his advocate  his edifice
how safe his fallen head
in her disheveled sanctity
above him is the sky
oblivion bendmg over him
and honor leagues away
why should we hurry  why indeed
when every way we by
we are molested equally
by immortality
no respite from the inference
that this which is begun
though where its labors lie
a bland uncertainty
besets the sight
this mighty night
of glory not a beam is left
but her eternal house
the asterisk is for the dead
the living for the stars
the immortality she gave
we borrowed at her grave
for just one plaudit famishing
the might of human love
a cap of lead across the sky
was tight and surly drawn
we could not find the mighty face
the figure was withdrawn
a chill came up as from a shaft
our noon became a well
a thunder storm combines the charms
of winter and of hell
a lane of yellow led the eye
unto a purple wood
whose soft mhabitants to be
surpasses solitude
if bird the silence contradict
or bower presume to show
in that low summer of the west
impossible to know
a word made flesh is seldom
and tremblingly partook
nor then perhaps reported
but have i not mistook
each one of us has tasted
with ecstasies of stealth
the very food debated
to our specific strength
a word that breathes distinctly
has not the power to die
cohesive as the spirit
it may expire if he
made flesh and dwelt among us
could condescension be
like this consent of language
this loved philology
advance is lifes condition
the grave but a relay
supposed to be a termmus
that makes it hated so
the tunnel is not lighted
existence with a wall
is better we consider
than not exist at all
as we pass houses musing slow
if they be occupied
so minds pass minds
if they be occupied
beauty crowds me till i die
beauty mercy have on me
but if i exprre today
let it be in sight of thee
conferrmg with myself
my stranger disappeared
though first upon a berry fat
miraculously fared
how paltry looked my cares
my practise how absurd
superfluous my whole career
beside this travelling bird
down times quamtstream
without an oar
weare enforced to sail
our port a secret
our perchance a gale
what skipper would
incur the risk
what buccaneer would ride
without a surety from the wind
or schedule of the tide
eden is that oldfashioned house
we dwell in every day
without suspecting our abode
until we drive away
how fair on looking back the day
we sauntered from the door
unconscious our returning
but discover it no more
endanger it and the demand
of tickets for a sigh
amazes the humility
of credibility
recover it to nature
and that dejected fleet
find consternations carmval
divested of its meat
fame is a fickle food
upon a shifting plate
whose table once a
guest but not
the second time is set
whose crumbs the crows mspect
and with ironic caw
flap past it to the
farmers com
men eat of it and die
glory is that bright tragic thing
that for an instant
means dominion
warms some poor name
that never felt the sun
gently replacing
in oblivion
guest am i to have
light my northern room
ivhy to cordiality so averse to come
other friends adjourn
other bonds decay
why avoid so narrowly
my fidelity
he went by sleep that drowsy route
to the surmising inn
at day break to begm his race
or ever to remain
his mind of man a secret makes
i meet him with a start
he carries a circumference
in which i have no part
or even if i deem i do
he otherwise may know
impregnable to inquest
however neighborly
i did not reach thee
but my feet slip nearer every day
three rivers and a hill to cross
one desert and a sea
i shall not count the journey one
when i am telling thee
two deserts but the year is cold
so that will help the sand
one desert crossed
the second one
will feel as cool as land
sahara is too little price
to pay for thy right hand
the sea comes last step merry feet
so short we have to go
to play together we are prone
but we must labor now
the last shall be the lightest load
that we have had to draw
the sun goes crooked
that is night
before he makes the bend
we must have passed the middle sea
almost we wish the end
were further off
too great it seems
so near the whole to stand
we step like plush
we stand like snow
the waters murmur new
three rivers and the hill are passed
two deserts and the sea
now death usurps my premium
and gets the look at thee
i know of people in the grave
who would be very glad
to know the news i know tonight
if they the chance had had
tis this expands the least event
and swells the scantest deed
my right to walk upon the earth
if they this moment had
i see thee clearer for the grave
that took thy face between
no mirror could illumine thee
like that impassive stone
i know thee better for the act
that made thee first unknown
the stature of the empty nest
attests the bird thats gone
i watched her face to see which way
she took the awful news
whether she died before she heard
or in protracted bruise
remained a few slow years with us
each heavier than the last
a further afternoon to fail
as flower at fall of frost
if i could tell how gladi was
i should not be so glad
but when i cannot make the force
nor mould it into word
i know it is a sign
that new dilemma be
from mathematics further off
than from eternity
in snow thou comest
thou shalt go with the resummg ground
the sweet derision of the crow
and glees advancing sound
in fear thou comest
thou shalt go at such a gait of joy
that man anew embark to live
upon the depth of thee
in winter in my room
i came upon a worm
pink lank and warm
but as he was a worm
and worms presume
not quite with him at home
secured him by a string
to something neighbormg
and went along
a trifle afterward
a thing occurred
id not believe it if i heard
but state with creeping blood
a snake with mottles rare
surveyed my chamber floor
in feature as the worm before
but ringed with power
the very string with which
i tied him  too
when he was mean and new
that string was there
i shrank  how falr you are
propitiations claw
afraid he hissed
of me
no cordiality
he fathomed me
then to a rhythm slim
secreted in his form
as patterns swim
projected him
that time i hew
both eyes hls way
lest he pursue
nor ever ceased to run
till in a distant town
towns on from mine
i set me down
this was a dream
judgment is justest
when the judged
his action laid away
divested is of every disk
but his sincerity
honor is then the safest hue
in a posthumous sun
not any color will endure
that scrutiny can bum
lightly stepped a yellow star
to its lofty place
loosed the moon her sliver hat
from her lustral face
all of evening softly lit
as an astral hall
father i observed to heaven
you are punctual
nature can do no more
she has fulfilled her dyes
whatever flower fail to come
of other summer days
her crescent reimburse
if other summers be
natures imposing negative
nulls opportunity
not any sunny tone
from any fervent zone
find entrance there
better a grave of balm
toward human natures home
and robins near
than a stupendous tomb
proclaiming to the gloom
how dead we are
of this is day composed
a mornmg and a noon
a revelry unspeakable
and then a gay unknown
whose pomps allure and spurn
and dower and deprive
and penury for glory
remechlessly leave
of yellow was the outer sky
in yellower yellow hewn
till saffron m vermilion sird
whose seam could not be shewn
on my volcano grows the grass
a meditative spot
an acre for a bird to choose
would be the general thought
how red the fire rocks below
how insecure the sod
did i disclose
would populate with awe my solitude
peril as a possession
tis good to bear
danger disintegrates satiety
theres basis there
begets an awe
that searches human natures creases
as clean as fire
rather arid delight
if contentment accrue
make an abstemious ecstasy
not so good as joy
but raptures expense
must not be incurred
with a tomorrow knocking
and the rent unpaid
sometimes with the heart
seldom with the soul
scarcer once with the might
fewlove at all
speech is one symptom of affection
and silence one
the perfectest communication
is heard of none
exists and its indorsement
is had within
behold said the apostle
yet had not seen
summer begins to have the look
peruser of enchanting book
reluctantly but sure perceives
a gain upon the backward leaves
autumn begms to be mferred
by millinery of the cloud
or deeper color in the shawl
that wraps the everlasting hill
the eye begins its avarice
a meditation chastens speech
some dyer of a distant tree
resumes his gaudy industry
conclusion is the course of all
at most to be perennial
and then elude stability
recalls to immortality
that she forgot me was the least
i felt it second pain
that i was worthy to forget
was most i thought upon
faithful was all that i could boast
but constancy became
to her by her innominate
a something like a shame
the blunder is in estimate
eternity is there
we say as of a station
meanwhile he is so near
he joins me in my ramble
divides abode with me
no friend have i that so persists
as this eternity
the butterfly obtams
but httle sympathy
though favorably mentioned
in entomology
because he travels freely
and wears a proper coat
the circumspect are certain
that he is dissolute
had he the homely scutcheon
of modest industry
twere  tter certifying
for immortality
the event was directly behind him
yet he did not guess
fitted itself to himself like a robe
relished his ignorance
motioned itself to drill
loaded and levelled
and let his flesh
centuries from his soul
the gleam of an heroic act
such sqange illumination
the possibles slow fuse is lit
by the imagination
the hills erect their purple heads
the rivers lean to see
yet man has not of all the throng
a curiosity
the look of thee what is it like
hast thou a hand or foot
or mansion of identity
and what is thy pursuit
thy fellows are they realms or themes
hast thou delight or fear
or longtng  and is that for us
or values more severe
let change transfuse all other traits
enact all other blame
but deign this least certificate
that thou shalt be the same
the ones that disappeared are back
the phoebe and the crow
precisely as in march is heard
the curtness of the jay
be this an autumn or a spring
my wisdom loses way
one side of me the nuts are ripe
the other side is may
the overtakelessness of those
who have accomplished death
majestic is to me beyond
the majesties of earth
the soul her not at home
inscribes upon the flesh
and takes her fair aerial gait
beyond the hope of touch
the right to perish might be thought
an undisputed right
attempt it and the universe
upon the opposite
will concentrate its officers
you cannot even die
but nature and mankind must pause
to pay you scrutiny
the sun retired to a cloud
a womans shawl as big
and then he sulked in mercury
upon a scarlet log
the drops on natures forehead stood
home flew the loaded bees
the south unrolled a purple fan
and handed to the trees
the wind drew off
like hungry dogs
defeated of a bone
through fissures in
volcanic cloud
the yellow lightning shone
the trees held up
their mangled limbs
like ammals in pain
when nature falls upon herself
beware an austrian
there is a solitude of space
a solitude of sea
a sohtude of death but these
society shall be
compared with that profounder slte
that polar privacy
a soul admitted to itself
finite infinity
these are the days that remdeer love
and pranks the northern stai
this is the suns objective
and finland of the year
they talk as slow as legends grow
no mushroom is their mind
but foliage of sterility
too stolid for the wmd
they laugh as wise as plots of wit
predestined to unfold
the point with bland prevision
portentously untold
tis easier to pity those when dead
that which pity previous
would have saved
a tragedy enacted
secures applause
that tragedy enacting
too seldom does
to do a magnanimous thmg
and take oneself by surprise
if oneself is not in the habit of him
is precisely the finest of joys
not to do a magnanimous thing
notwithstanding it never be known
notwithstanding it cost us existence once
is rapture herself spurn
to tell the beauty would decrease
to state the spell demean
there is a syllableless sea
of which it is the sign
my will endeavors for its word
and fails but entertains
a rapture as of legacies
of introspective mines
to their apartment deep
no ribaldry may creep
untumbled this abode
by any man but god
today or this noon
she dwelt so close
i almost touched her
tonight she lies
past neighborhood
and bough and steeple
now past surmise
twas comfort in her dying room
to hear the living clock
a short relief to have the wind
walk boldly up and knock
diversion from the dying theme
to hear the children play
but wrong the more
that these could live
and this of ours must die
unto a broken heart
no other one may go
without the high prerogative
itself hath suffered too
volcanoes be m sicily
and south america
i judge from my geography
volcanos nearer here
a lava step at any time
am i inclmed to climb
a crater i may contemplate
vesuvius at home
when we have ceased to care
the gift is given
for which we gave the earth
and mortgaged heaven
but so declmed m worth
tis ignominy now
to look upon
winter under cultivation
is as arable as spring
witchcraft has not a pedigree
tis early as our breath
and mourners meet it going out
the moment of our death
with sweetness unabated
informed the hour had come
with no remiss of triumph
the autumn started home
her home to be with nature
as competitlon done
by influential kinsmen
invited to return
in supplements of purple
an adequate repast
in heavenly reviewing
her residue be past
a curious cloud surprised the sky
twas like a sheet with horns
the sheet was blue
the antlers gray
it almost touched the lawns
so low it leaned  then statelier drew
and trailed like robes away
a queen adown a satin aisle
had not the majesty
a face devoid of love or grace
a hateful hard successful face
a face with which a stone
would feel as thoroughly at ease
as were they old acquaintances
first time together thrown
a pit  but heaven over it
and heaven beside and heaven abroad
and yet a pit
with heaven over it
to stir would be to slip
to look would be to drop
to dreamto sap the prop
that holds my chances up
ah pit with heaven over it
the depth is all my thought
i dare not ask my feet
twould start us where we sit
so straight youd scarce suspect
it was a pit  with fathoms under it
its circuit just the same
seedsummertomb
whose doom to whom
as subtle as tomorrow
that never came
a warrant a conviction
yet but a name
by a departing light
we see acuter quite
than by a wick that stays
theres something in the flight
that clarifies the sight
and decks the rays
consulting summers clock
but half the hours remain
i ascertain it with a shock
i shall not look again
the second half of joy
is shorter than the first
the truth i do not dare to know
i muffle with a jest
death is like the insect
menacmg the tree
competent to kill it
but decoyed may be
bait it with the balsam
seek it with the saw
bafhe if it cost you
everything you are
then if it have burrowed
out of reach of skill
wring the tree and leave it
tis the vermins will
did lifes penurious length
italicize its sweetness
the men that daily live
would stand so deep in joy
that it would clog the cogs
of that revolving reason
whose esoteric belt
protects our sanity
drowning is not so pitiful
as the attempt to rise
three times tis said a sinking man
comes up to face the skies
and then declines forever
to that abhorred abode
there hope and he part company
for he is grasped of god
the makers cordial visage
however good to see
is shunned we must admit it
like an adversity
god is indeed a jealous god
he cannot bear to see
that we had rather not with him
but with each other play
had i known that the first was the last
i should have kept it longer
had i known that the last was the first
i should have drunk it stronger
cup it was your fault
lip was not the liar
no lip it was yours
bliss was most to blame
he was my host  he was my guest
i never to this day
if i vlted him could tell
or he vited me
so infinite our intercourse
so intimate indeed
analysis as capsule seemed
to keeper of the seed
her face was in a bed of hair
like flowers in a plot
her hand was whiter than the sperm
that feeds the sacred light
her tongue more tender than the tune
that totters  the leaves
who hears may be incredulous
who witnesses believes
high from the earth i heard a bird
he trod upon the trees
as he esteemed them trifles
and then he spied a breeze
and situated softly
upon a pile of wind
which in a perturbation
nature had left behind
a joyous going fellow
i gathered from his talk
which both of benediction
and badinage partook
without apparent burden
i subsequently learned
he was the faithful father
of a dependent brood
and this untoward transport
his remedy for care
a contrast to our respites
how different we are
how dare the robins smg
when men and women hear
who since they went to their account
have settled with the year
paid all that life had earned
in one consummate bill
and now what hfe or death can do
is immaterial
insulting is the sun
to him whose mortal light
beguiled of immortahty
bequeaths him to the night
extinct be every hum
in deference to him
whose garden wrestles with the dew
at daybreak overcome
i took one draught of life
ill tell you what i paid
precisely an existence
the market price they said
they weighed me dust by dust
they balanced film with film
then handed me my beings worth
a single dram of heaven
if all the griefs i am to have
would only come today
i am so happy i believe
theyd laugh and run away
if all the joys i am to have
would only come today
they could not be so big as this
that happens to me now
if ever the lid gets off my head
and lets the brain away
the fellow will go where he belonged
without a hint from me
and the world  if the world be looking on
will see how far from home
it is possible for sense to live
the soul there  all the time
is immortality a bane
that men are so oppressed
ive got an arrow here
loving the hand that sent it
i the dart revere
fell they will say in skirmish
vanquished my soul will know
by but a simple arrow
sped by an archers bow
lethemmy fl ower
of which they who drink
in the fadeless orchards
hear the bobolink
merely flake or petal
as the eye beholds
jupiter my father
i perceive the rose
love can do all but raise the dead
i doubt if even that
from such a giant were withheld
were flesh equivalent
but love is tired and must sleep
and hungry and must graze
and so abets the shming fleet
till it is out of gaze
my life closed twice before its close
it yet remains to see
if immortality unveil
a third event to me
so huge so hopeless to conceive
as these that twice befell
parting is all we know of heaven
and all we need of hell
no man saw awe nor to his house
admitted he a man
though by his awful residence
has human nature been
not deeming of his dread abode
t iii laboring to flee
a grasp on comprehension laid
detamed vitality
returning is a different route
the spirit could not show
for breathing is the only work
to be enacted now
am not consumed old moses wrote
yet saw him face to face
that very physiognomy
i am convinced was this
oh honey of an hour
i never knew thy power
prohibit me
till my mmutest dower
my unfrequented flower
deserving be
one crown that no one seeks
and yet the highest head
its isolatlon coveted
its stigma delfied
while pontius pilate lives
in whatsoever hell
that coronation pierces him
he recollects it well
proud of my broken heart smce thou didst break it
proud of the pain i did not feel till thee
proud of my night since thou wlth moons dost slake it
not to partake thy passion my humllity
thou canst not boast like jesus drunken wlthout compamon
was the strong cup of anguish brewed for the nazarene
thou canst not pierce tradition with the peerless puncture
see i usurped thy crucifix to honor mme
rearrange a wifes affection
when they dislocate my brain
amputate my freckled bosom
make me bearded like a man
blush my spirit in thy fastness
blush my unacknowledged clay
seven years of troth have taught thee
more than wifehood ever may
love that never leaped its socket
trust entrenched in narrow pain
constancy thro fire  awarded
anguish  bare of anodynel
burden  borne so far triumphant
none suspect me of the crown
for i wear the thorns till sunset
then  my diadem put on
big my secret but its handaged
it will never get away
till the day its weary keeper
leads it through the grave to thee
softened by times consummate plush
how sleek the woe appears
that threatened childhoods citadel
and undermined the years
bisected now by bleaker griefs
we envy the despair
that devastated childhoods realm
so easy to repair
some say goodnight at night
i say goodnight by day
goodbye  the going utter me
goodnight i still reply
for parting that is night
and presence simply dawn
itself the purple on the height
denominated morn
sweet is the swamp with its secrets
until we meet a snake
tis then we sigh for houses
and our departure take
at that enthralling gallop
that only childhood knows
a snake is summers treason
and guile is where it goes
that it will never come again
is what makes life so sweet
believing what we dont believe
does not exhilarate
that if it be it be at best
an ablative estate
this instigates an appetite
precisely opposite
the distance that the dead have gone
does not at first appear
their coming back seems possible
for many an ardent year
and then that we have followed them
we more than half suspect
so intimate have we become
with their dear retrospect
the grave my little cottage is
where keeping house for thee
i make my parlor orderly
and lay the marble tea
for two divided briefly
a cycle it may be
till everlastmg life unite
in strong society
the joy that has no stern nor core
nor seed that we can sow
is edible to longing
but ablative to show
by fundamental palates
those products are preferred
impregnable to transit
and patented by pod
the mob within the heart
police cannot suppress
the riot given at the first
is authorized as peace
uncertified of scene
or signified of sound
but growing like a hurricane
in a congenial ground
the most important population
unnoticed dwell
they have a heaven each instant
not any hell
their names unless you know them
twere useless tell
of bumblebees and other nations
the grass is full
the parasol is the umbrellas daughter
and associates with a fan
while her father abuts the tempest
and abridges the rain
the former assists a siren
in her serene display
but her father is borne and honored
and borrowed to this day
the reticent volcano keeps
his never slumbering plan
confided are his projects pmk
to no precarious man
if nature will not tell the tale
jehovah told to her
can human nature not survive
without a hstener
admonished by her buckled lips
let every babbler be
the only secret people keep
is immortality
the waters chased him as he bed
not daring look behind
a billow whispered in his ear
corne home with me my friend
my parlor is of shriven glass
my pantry has a fish
for every palate in the year
to this revolting bliss
the object floating at his side
made no distinct reply
the words the happy say
are paltry melody
but those the silent feel
are beautiful
there comes an hour when begging stops
when the long interceding lips
perceive their prayer is vain
thou shalt not is a kinder sword
than from a disappointing god
disciple call again
this docile one inter
while we who dare to live
arraign the sunny brevity
that sparkled to the grave
on her departing span
no wilderness remain
as dauntless in the house of death
as if it were her own
through those old grounds of memory
the sauntering alone
is a divine intemperance
a prudent man would shun
of liquors that are vended
tis easy to beware
but statutes do not meddle
with the internal bar
pernicious as the sunset
permitting to pursue
but impotent to gather
the tranquil perfidy
alloys our firmer moments
with that severest gold
convement to the longmg
but otherwise withheld
to lose thee  sweeter than to gain
all other hearts i knew
tis true the drought is destitute
but then i had the dew
the caspian has its realms of sand
its other realm of sea
without the sterile perqulslte
no caspian could be
to make a praliie it takes a clover and one bee
one clover and a bee
and revery
the revery alone will do
if bees are few
twas here my summer paused
what npeness after then
to other scene or other soul
my sentence had begun
to wmter to remove
with winter to abide
go manacle your icicle
against your tropic bride
upon the gallows hung a wretch
too sullied for the hell
to which the law entitled him
as natures curtam fell
the one who bore him tottered m
for this was womans son
i twas all i had she stricken gasped
oh what a livid boon
where every bird is bold to go
and bees abashless play
the foreigner before he knocks
must thrust the tears away
which misses most
the hand that tends
or heart so gently borne
tis twice as heavy as it was
because the hand is gone
which blesses most
the lip that can
or that that went to sleep
with if i could endeavormg
without the strength to shape
elysium is as far as to
the very nearest room
if in that room a friend await
fehcity or doom
what fortitude the soul contains
that it can so endure
the accent of a coming foot
the opening of a door
a train went through a burial gate
a bird broke forth and sang
and trilled and quivered and shook his throat
till all the churchyard rang
and then adjusted his little notes
and bowed and sang again
doubtless he thought it meet of him
to say goodby to men
were nature mortal lady
who had so little time
to pack her trunk and order
the great exchange of clime
how rapid how momentous
what exigencies were
but nature will be ready
and have an hour to spare
to make some tnbe fairer
that was too fair before
enchanting by remaining
and by departure more
fame is a bee
it has a song
it has a sting
ah too it has a wing
the saddest noise the sweetest noise
the maddest noise that grows
the birds they make it in the spnng
at nights delicious close
between the march and april line
that magical frontier
beyond which summer hesitates
almost too heavenly near
it makes us think of all the dead
that sauntered with us here
by separations sorcery
made cruelly more dear
it makes us think of what we had
and what we now deplore
we almost wish those siren throats
would go and sing no more
an ear can break a human heart
as quickly as a spear
we wish the eal had not a heart
so dangerously near
that love is all there is
is all we know of love
it is enough the freight should be
proportioned to the groove
those final creatures who thev are
that faithful to the close
administer her ecstasy
but just the summer knows
sweet hours have perished here
thls is a mighty room
within its precincts hopes have played
now shadows in the tomb
lad of athens faithful be
to thyself
and mystery
all the rest is perjury
the longest day that god appoints
will finish with the sun
anguish can travel to its stake
and then it must return
experiment escorts us last
his pungent company
will not allow an axiom
an opportunity
how beet  how indiscreet an one
how always wrong is love
the joyfullutle deity
we are not scourged to serve
let me not thirst with this hock at my lip
nor beg with domains in my pocket
the summer that we did not prize
her treasures were so easy
instructs us by departing now
and recognition lazy
bestirs itselfputs on its coat
and scans with fatal promptness
for trains that moment out of sight
unconscious of his smartness
too happy tlme dissolves itself
and leaves no remnant by
tis anguish not a feather hath
or too much weight to by
the earth has many keys
where melody is not
is the unknown peninsula
beauty is natures fact
but witness for her land
and witness for her sea
the cricket is her utmost
of elegy to me
